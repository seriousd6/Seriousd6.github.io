            "Magic is Rare - The world’s magic is hard to find and harder to use. The vast majority is useless superstition, incredibly tedious to employ, or dangerous to the user, but what works tends to be stronger than the freely available magic of other worlds.", 
            "Magic is Dark - All but the weakest magic comes only through diabolical pacts and unspeakable deeds, and when it does, it is corrupting, chaotic, and catastrophic to the user and their victims alike.",
            "Magic takes Tools - The mortal mind can’t grasp any but the weakest of magic, only through artifice, scroll-scribbling, alchemy, and enchantments can its energies be brought to bear.", 
            "Magic is Demanding - Magic is both powerful and attainable, but it requires decades of difficult study, ironclad self-control, and immense personal sacrifice from its users.", 
            "Magic is Inherited - Only mortals descended from or greatly favored by supernatural entities can channel magic, and while great within its scope, their power is narrow and limited.", 
            "Magic is Common - The study of magic is well-known and widespread, to the extent a town may have a wizard living between its carpenter and smith, but due to its ubiquity, it tends to be weaker than the less available magic of other worlds.", 
            "Magic is Myriad - Numerous methods of magic exist, everything from dark pacts, to artificial tools, to arduous study, and simple circumstance of birth, and its divergent practitioners may have an intense and oft-bloody rivalry with one another.", 
            "Magic is Science - In their curiosity, mortals have codified and tested magic to the extent it’s seen as merely another discipline of science, and broadly implemented in technology.", 
            "Magic is Everywhere - Powerful magic is freely accessible, at minimal to no cost and risk to its users, and magical entities that may be rare in other worlds readily serve mortals in all aspects of life.", 
            "Magic is Bound - The mortal races aren’t able to wield magic on their own, instead they must give up a part of themselves to bind a spirit’s soul to theirs, or entrap a spirit in an item of precious value and force it to cast at its wielder’s command.",
            "Magic is Wild - Magic is an unpredictable and untamed force, constantly shifting and changing. Those who dare to use it must be prepared for unintended consequences, as the magic may have a will of its own.",
            "Magic is Forbidden - Governments, religions, or other powerful institutions have outlawed the use of magic. Its practice is hidden, secretive, and often associated with rebellion or criminality.",
            "Magic is Dying - Once vibrant and widespread, the world's magical energies are waning. The causes might be mysterious or known, but the effects are felt by all magic users, leading to a desperate race to preserve or exploit what remains.",
            "Magic is Nature - Magic is intertwined with the natural world, drawn from the plants, animals, and elements. It promotes harmony and balance but can be wrathful if misused or if nature is harmed.",
            "Magic is Monopolized - A single entity, be it a government, corporation, or individual, controls the majority of magical knowledge and resources. This concentration of power may lead to inequality, unrest, and conflict.",
            "Magic is Symbiotic - Magic can only be used through a mutual agreement or bond with magical creatures or entities. These relationships may be based on respect, manipulation, or coercion, and form a unique magical system.",
            "Magic is Time-bound - The use of magic is connected to specific times or celestial events. Whether it's phases of the moon, solstices, or other temporal factors, magic ebbs and flows with the passage of time.",
            "Magic is Sentient - The magical energies of the world are not merely a force to be harnessed but possess consciousness and intent. Communication, negotiation, or conflict with these sentient energies forms the basis of magical practice.",
            "Magic is Sacrificial - The power to wield magic requires physical, emotional, or spiritual sacrifices. The greater the magic, the greater the cost, leading to profound ethical dilemmas and personal struggles for those who pursue this path.",
            "Magic is Healing - The primary purpose and function of magic in this world is to heal and nurture. Combat and destructive uses of magic are rare or non-existent, and magical practice focuses on restoration, growth, and empathy.",
            "Magic is Transformative - Magic primarily functions to change and transmute, whether it's the alteration of objects, the metamorphosis of beings, or the shifting of reality itself. This leads to a world of constant flux and potential.",
            "Magic is Artistic - Magic is expressed through art, music, poetry, and other creative endeavors. The most powerful magic users are those with profound artistic talents, and magical duels might look more like artistic competitions.",
            "Magic is Ancestral - Magic is deeply rooted in family lines and traditions. Knowledge and abilities are passed down through generations, and a person's lineage may determine their potential as a magic user.",
            "Magic is Cultural - Different cultures within the world have unique magical traditions, methods, and philosophies. Interactions between these diverse magical systems can lead to cooperation, conflict, or synthesis.",
            "Magic is Gendered - Magic operates differently based on gender, with specific abilities or roles assigned to different genders. This can influence societal norms, relationships, and the personal journey of magic users.",
            "Magic is Cursed - Magic comes with inherent curses or risks that affect both the user and those around them. This might be a deliberate design by some higher power or a side effect of tapping into forces beyond mortal understanding.",
            "Magic is Compassionate - Magic is driven by empathy and compassion, acting as a force for good. It refuses to be used for harm or selfish gains and aligns itself with those who seek to make positive changes in the world.",
            "Magic is Seasonal - The power and nature of magic change with the seasons. Magic users must understand and adapt to these shifts, and some may specialize in the magic of a particular season.",
            "Magic is Collective - Magic is not an individual force but thrives on community, connection, and shared intention. It grows stronger when practiced collectively and may be weaker or even inaccessible to lone practitioners.",
            "Magic is Competitive - Magic is a central aspect of competition, sport, or games within the world. Mastery of magic is as much about strategy, teamwork, and skill as it is about understanding mystical forces.",
            "Magic is Love-bound - Magic is intimately tied to love and relationships. Whether it's romantic, familial, or platonic, the strength and nature of one's magical abilities are closely linked to their bonds with others.",
            "Magic is Dreamt - Magic is accessed and shaped within dreams. Dream mages walk a fine line between reality and imagination, and the dream world is a place of both incredible power and potential danger.",
            "Magic is Reflective - Magic acts as a mirror of the user's inner self, reflecting their virtues, flaws, desires, and fears. Personal growth and self-awareness become crucial in mastering this form of magic.",
            "Magic is Historical - Magic is tied to historical events, figures, or artifacts. The past holds the key to magical power, and those who delve into history can unlock abilities lost to time.",
            "Magic is Commercialized - Magic has become a commodity, bought and sold like any other good. This commercialization has broad impacts on the economy, society, ethics, and the personal experiences of magic users.",
            "Magic is Environmental - Magic is directly tied to the health and state of the environment. Pollution, deforestation, or other ecological issues can weaken or corrupt magic, leading to a complex relationship between magic users and their world.",
            "Magic is Regional - Magic varies significantly by geography, with different regions having access to unique magical resources, traditions, or restrictions. This creates a rich tapestry of magical diversity across the world.",
