//SHOPKEEPERS

        "Imp Imporium - This store is small and boxy, and entirely made of redwood. A tall devil stands behind the counter wearing a suit and tie, and imps are chained to the walls. He offers you the services of one of his imps for a small price- the rights to the imp's memories of what they did when you're done. He requires a much larger material collateral for if you don't return the imp or it dies/is irreparably maimed in your service.", "Coagulation Station - A seemingly normal (if ugly) old woman runs this roadside popup store. It is nothing more than a cart with a sign next to it reading 'Coagulation Station' painted roughly in red over a lime background. She offers healing supplies, potions, and rations in return for a small vial of your blood. (Feel free to come up with consequences for buying from her, such as her being a hag or using it for a strange ritual, etc.)", "Elemental Extras - An air, earth, fire and water elemental stand in the four corners of this (entirely brick) shop. Unfortunately, the 'shopkeepers' only speak primordial, so good luck if you don't. They each offer to put special elemental effects on whatever you own, such as a fire effect on your sword, an ice effect on your armor to freeze whatever hits you, or an earth effect on an arrow to have surrounding dirt swallow whoever it hits. Everything here is understandably very expensive.", 
        "Vraug aks stor - A very tall, older orc hero enthusiastically tries to sell his weapons in this shop in order to retire. They're hung up on the walls, all showing varying signs of use. Some appear to be magical. Vraug also tries to tell his customers stories about each weapon before they buy (and especially before they ask.) The weapon most prominently displayed is a +4 Great Axe, with obsidian blades, a dragon-scale tip on the end and golden threads running down the handle. There are a few chinks in it, and the tip somehow has a dent in it, but the damage only seems to add to the charm. He charges an extraordinary price for this axe.", "Angel Bazaar - Apparently recently the churches haven't been generating enough coin to keep the local deity fiscally afloat, and some angels have taken it upon themselves to raise that extra money. Some are selling more regular items for cheaper prices, such as healing items, some are selling more extravagant magical items, and even others are offering 'miracles.' They're all set up in a series of stands in a small square that you swear wasn't here before.", "Betsie's Black Cauldron- everything is black, especially Betsie. From black oak ethanol to black licorice she has ingredients and potions unique to her gimmick.", "The Fleeting Flyer's Fast Findings - if the item floats, flies, or is otherwise airborne this shop might have it. Limited time only and has (randomized) a rare three uncommons and six commons but the more you travel the more likely you are to come across it because it's on a one man spell jammer with two carnival cars behind it.", 
        "The Kyuss Kasino- a worm themed casino where the main attraction is the purple tunnel which is a purple worm in a metal harness designed to prevent it from moving and to keep its mouth open. The wager, and incidentally, the show is if you can make it out the other end alive you win]. There are scrying orbs that display a live feed of the current 'adventurer' in the worm for 5 silver lasting 30 min before the next five silver (no refunds). Quest hook?", "Djinni Gin Jamboree- a once a month festival celebrating a moon cycle of the dm's choosing. Marids sell their distilled saliva as well as various forms of never-before-seen-by-man fish dishes, and water elementals play live music which more or less sounds like the rhythmic gurgling of a muddy brook.", "The Crossroads Corridor - An invite only shop, given to adventures who have a number of their own magical items. When the invitation is slid under any closed doorway, said doorway will become the doorway to the shop. Operated by The Masked Man, it is a magical item shop that trades magical items for magical items of similar value. Leaving will exit out the door you originally put the invitation under.",
        "Bottom's Bottomless Meatpies - It's cheap, delicious (although a bit gamey and hard to chew) and the servings are enormous. The shop is run by an old goblin with an enormous smile, his name is Toothy Bottom, less so because of his bum, and more so because of a secret that he isn't telling any one, the secret that has made his Meatpie-shop the most well visited in the entire area, at least by those not able to afford fine dining in the upper districts.For you see, underneath this humble shopped, staffed every hour of every day with more goblins than you can count on one hand, or two hands if you have taken ABM (Advanced Barbarian Maths), lies a large, cavernous mining operation.You enter it through a set of large trap-doors found in the cold-store basement where you find the literal wheelbarrows of meat that allow every customer to order however much meat they want in (or on) their pies, as long as the Goblins can lift it up to the counter (the largest order so far was, according to the Goblins managing the front of the house, 'the weight of a small baby wrapped in a nasty hunting dog.' they have made no comment as to how they know that specific measurement).Once you are through the trap-doors, you'll find a rail-system rivaling that of the largest Dwarven mines, with rail-master goblins timing and directing all the in- and out- going traffic, and every cart that comes in is absolutely and utterly loaded with meat, which is then loaded on wheelbarrows and carted up through the trapdoor.If you were to follow the rails as deep as they go, through all of the winding tunnels, across chasms, past various cave-dwelling monsters that try to snack on the meat or goblins or, well, you, then you'll eventually find yourself at the namesake of mr. Toothy Bottom.A large, mass of rock-hard skin, covered in spines and horns and other sharp shapes, it has been split open, and the dark flesh underneath is mined ceaselessly by a small army of Goblins. They aren't violent, in fact, they are quite cowardly, but they are as professional as any Goblin can be, and they are also fighting a continuous fight against the flesh with their pickaxes.For you see, the open wound is constantly trying to close itself, regenerating at a blinding speed that the Goblins have learned to keep up with after opening the wound large enough to allow for their massive excavation progress.This may be the toothy bottom of the pits and chasms.But it is also a small area of the sleeping Tarrasque, regenerating fast enough that it does not notice the harm being done to it, and with a large enough Goblin Workforce to drive the economy of what is, essentially, a small Goblin Kingdom in these tunnels, complete with blacksmiths making new Meat-axes and monster-hide-leathercrafters making workboots and pants for the Goblins working down in that caustic blood.And let's not forget, that the entire lower class of the city has eaten Tarrasque meat at least once, some of them for years.But it's only two silver pieces for as much pie as you want (or can carry), so who cares to ask where it's all coming from?", "Sarah’s sewing shop, 'World class Seamstress.' - She means world class! She can repair even magical fabric to like new condition. Everything she makes alterations to gives them a +1 to charisma for 24hrs or until dirtied. Bonus returns after being thoroughly washed and dried (some items are dry clean only)She’s also a dry cleaners.byte",
        "The Philosopher’s Time Shop - Sundials, watches, windup clocks, candle clocks, hourglasses the size of mites up to the size of your average goliath, the Philosopher has a range to suit almost any buyer in need of a way to measure time. Be careful, the hours you spend there fly away like seconds!", "Oakshot Saddliery - Gwinnett Oakshot caters to a select clientele, those looking for clothes, armour, weapons and equipment specifically designed to suit those who spend at least part of their days in a different body shape. Minor magic at most, it’s mostly just very well designed to suit your Druid on the go or werebeing out for a night on the town.", "Jasper, Goldhand, Bloodstrangler and Smith - What does '‘til death us do part' mean if your wife is now a lich? Does a lifetime guarantee still stand if the object in question broke before the manufacturers were born? What exactly is an annuity? The firm of JGB&S is on hand to assist with non-devilish contracts of any kind.", "Morogh's 'Pet's' - This pet shelter is run by an older halfling named Morogh. He's kindhearted and only wants the best for his little animal companions he sells. From apes over hawks to wolfs, he just has every animal companion you could think of, but his store also has a back area. Not everyone is welcomed there as he also sells abandoned monster hatchlings, like griffons, owlbears, pseudodragons and even a red dragon wyrmling. Those monsters are all tamed so no danger there, Morogh just wants to know his customers better before trying to sell one of his more 'exotic' assets.The adventurers maybe can persuade him or do a favor for him (possible quest), like acquiring some exotic food for the more demanding beasts and monsters he houses. After this Morogh decides to sell them one of his monsters as a companion.", "Plane Ole' Butcher - A butcher shop that sells meat from an unknown plane of origin. One day a small portal opened up from the ground and strange-smelling exotic meats have been extruding from the portal. A shop was built around the portal which has been active and pumping for 50 years. People come to see the wonder firsthand but they stay for the dirt-cheap meats. The meats are char-grilled and heavily spiced to soften the meat's naturally pungent flavor.",
        "Looters Late Return (aka LooLaRe)- A seedy smelling store run by an androgynous goblin who wears overly fancy clothes. This goblin sells in bulk only, and at discounted prices. The catch is that if you make a purchase, you must sign a contract guaranteeing repeated weekly purchases. Your bulk discount increases the more product you are able to move, but if you are unable to maintain your weekly purchases, the goblin’s secret network of enforcers comes for it’s dues. Or your life.", "Sandman Fisheries - This tightly packed stall smells or marine air and salty nets. It has all the sea can offer to the gourmet with a striking emphasis on huge fish: tuna, spadefish, and the occasional gargantuan squid. The product is impeccably fresh. Always. Sandman (a desert dweller and camel race aficionado) doesn't seem to understand what you're asking about the supply chain and how come his shop ever exists at hundred of miles from the nearest sea!", "T'zargo's fine wares - This shop can be mysteriously seen in any plane, but always appears as an identical modern convenience store looking building. Inside is a tabaxi named T'zargo, always advertising his 'fine wares at reasonable prices.' He sells extremely rare and powerful items for millions of gold, along with random everyday items. Some of these rare items include an axe once wielded by Baphomet, and draws from a deck of many things. His mundane items he always pulls out of a box on his counter, and they include a full rowboat and 30 chairs.", 
        "The Magic Commoner - A basic magic item shop owned by a young elf wizard named Tavon Ilidan. He sells all sorts of magical things from armor to weapons and rings an such.The thing about his shop even though on the outside it looked like a regular building despite being one solid color; purple, orange, green ect. But when you walk inside it's much larger than its outward appearance.The shop also travels via a magical door. Tavon has a set of different keys he keeps with him representing the different cities of the land/world. He first closes the front door, locks it, then unlocks it with a new city key and when he opens it, it opens to the new city.Tavon's appearance reflects on which city he is in and what color his shop is. If is shop is blue his robes are blue as well. Tavon also has a secret. Even though he looks like a young elf he is actually an ancient gold dragon that simply likes to travel and meet new people without the stigma of being a dragon. He likes to play tricks on people and test them to see if they are worthy of specific items in his shop, (IE a wand of fireballs he made himself.)", "Mallard Maladies - A veterinary clinic for ducks. The shop keeper is an old blind man who refuses to heal non duck creatures, but can be tricked into healing non ducks with a high enough deception ability. Despite the name, the clinic services male and female ducks.",
        "The Exploding Wand Shop- A shop that is characterized by an explosion that lifts the roof of the building off the walls and expelled black smoke every few hours - followed by the owner shouting from inside 'I'M FINE, EVERYTHING'S OKAY!'The owner is a young Eladrin Artificer named Seyf Melorathian who experiments on new wands and other magical wonders. His face is a black charcoal from the soot of the explosions but otherwise would be a light brown. He has a pair of glasses that protects his eyes from being covered in soot. He has blond hair and wears a Smith's apron. He sells common rarity wands, up to rare rarity wonderous items, and has been working on an experimental wand of fireballs. You can only purchase an experimental wand if you do a material gathering quest for him.If you buy one of his wand of fireballs (2000gp and a waiver signed to not sue) there's a 10% chance that when used the wand will cast a second fireball centered on you during the spell.He also offers enchanting services at various speeds depending on the rarity of the requested enchantment. He will also willingly take on apprentices or teach enchantment to anyone.", "Fishman’s Man Fry – A Triton, named Vamras Vogalath, with broken Common serves delectable seafood dishes. If asked about the name, he explains that it is food FOR men, not for fishes.Side note- this is shop is not anywhere near any large body of water. Nobody in town is sure exactly where the fish come from.",
        "Shwarma Tent - delicious herb infused fried flatbread with cured meats and shredded carrot and cucumber. The tent has small tripod tables and stools of worn wood. Patrons carve their names and other messages into the tabletops. Among the mundane names can be found the names of previous characters and NPCs that the party met, BBEGs they defeated, dated long ago, the current ruler of the land and the name of an old lover with a heart around it, Ash Ketchum, Drizzt, The Doctor, and the original Avengers. Searching carefully can also reveal a cryptic message to the party, seemingly carved years prior, but naming the PCs.", "Threads of Fate - three old sisters weave spidersilk and mundane silk into beautiful garments with embroidery that sometimes changes its image. For instance, a nightrobe has the moon and a starry sky embroidered, and the moon changes its phase with the real moon. On another, a dragon slowly chases its own tail, with its wingtips pointing to the time, as a clock. Yet another displays an hourglass which constantly drains, and runs out when the wearer dies. Other images might show great moving battles, gently waving flags that slowly fade and dilapidate as the empire becomes more corrupt, or ruins that become progressively overgrown with vines. The theme of the garments deal with the passage of time and the inevitable end of life.", "Salty's - the owner Saltamancia sells salt of differing coarseness and colors, and is an expert on which textures best compliment which purposes, from baking fine rolls to soaking one's feet after a days march. He has certain rare salts from distant lands with rare properties. For abjuring circles, he has a blessed salt that cannot be dispersed by gusts of wind. For healing, he has a fine blue salt that, when mixed with honey and packed into a wound, prevents infection and scarring. Another salt taken with hot peppermint tea can remove an additional level of exhaustion with a rest. True to his name, Saltamancia is old and curmudgeonly", 
        "Bestboots - Bestboots sells custom footwear of exceeding quality, made from rare materials. The footwear can be light for nimble moves or heavy for kicking doors. With the right materials (possibly a quest) minor advantages can be built into the footwear. For example, a sole of felted yeti hair can give normal traction on ice, and a sole of gummed soapwood sap can allow the wearer to ignore a casting of grease underfoot.", "Hap's Microbrews - Hap claims to have perfected the means of beer portability, in that his brews are bottled and sealed under pressure in containers of lightweight spun cellulose which dont shatter when dropped. Opening his bottled beer releases a small localized burst of cold, chilling the beer just shy of freezing. The locals generally ignore his cart and 'ice cold beer' sign, as ales are meant to be drunk at room temperature so that they don't unsettle the stomach.

A special lightly waxed paper is waterproof and can be written on underwater with a special pencil. A waterproof scrollcase holds six tightly rolled papers in individual tubes, designed so you can immediately draw out the scroll you desire without searching through a sheaf of papers.

The guy working there isn't the owner, but is happy to teach you how to use his goods. While distracting you with a card trick, he will also attempt to shortchange you or pickpocket something (minus 4 to notice his ledgerdemain). If caught, he will only say 'check your pocket' and there you will find the item you thought he pickpocketed. 'Its all part of the trick, man,' he will say, as he pulls a coin from your ear.", "The Bee's Knees - honey from different types of flowers with exceptional flavors. Meads of each type are also sold, as well as bee pollen and honey candies. A honey from frostclover will quickly dispell a hangover. Phasebee royal jelly can allow an additional use of misty step for a character with that feature, but the cost is exorbitant.

Marin runs this fine tobacconist. House blends of pipe and cigarette tobacco can have classic Gandolf effects: controllable luminous smoke rings of various colors, and custom flavors and scents.

Mr. Marin can craft custom peace pipes of nearly any light weapon.",

Custom saddles can be made for any beast. A saddle on display is embossed 'ride me hard and put me away wet.' It isn't for sale, and it looks like it would fit Bill. He can craft a skin-tight custom leather armor that is concealable under clothing, but the customer must go into the back of the shop for a very long and invasive fitting. Rumor has it that some customers never emerge.", "Yellow Dancer - This is a musical instrument store run by a purple-haired elf named Lancer who was a freedom fighter in the past. His sister, Yellow Dancer herself, a famous concert performer who is a recognized star, is sometimes there in his place. Instruments of high quality and beginner pieces are sold. On commission, Lancer can craft an instrument which contains a secret sheath for a hidden weapon or wand. Also sold is 'the Axe,' a battleaxe/guitar combo, with a magical property of sound amplification that allows it to be heard in the largest venue, and allows for unique distortion effects. At DM Option, the Axe can also be used for ranged sonic attacks, mimicking the effects of Eldritch Blast.", "The Titty Twister: an adult entertainment venue, mostly for merchants and caravan guards. A goblin barker in a tophat and coattails out front gives a spirited pitch about the feminine wonders to be found within. Inside is a seedy establishment styled to look like an ancient temple. Billiards and darts games line the walls, and a poker game is playing out at a table near the center. Its a rough crowd, and fights that break out are settled with the loser being dragged away by the bouncers and the winner buying a round for the house. Beautiful dancers take turns on stage and mingle with clients between songs. Private shows are available. During the day the massive door is barred and the place is eerily silent, but from dusk til dawn raucous action is there for the taking. Locals stay well clear and pray for protection if they must pass near this den of sin.",

Arguments over rules are common, and are arbitrated by a robed and wigged judge on a low dias at one end, who often consults an enormous tome of rules which only he is allowed to read from. 1sp per game, per player, but by convention, the loser pays the fees of his opponents.

They seem highly intelligent, and will also take shiny items, food and booze. It's hard to ask them for any specific item, without a druid or ranger that can communicate properly, but not impossible. Nobody knows where they get the things they sell.", "The treant - You enter the store, it's a mess: some shelves are broken, their content crashed on the ground, the floor is covered in leaves and branches. Behind the counter, an enormous tree. It's too tall for the room, so its upper part is bent in a really odd way against the ceiling, covering the entire room with its branches. You notice there is a face in the wood, a mouth opens, and with a deep voice that makes the whole building shake, it speaks 'Welcome, how can I.... uh... help you lil' saplings... ye?' This treant always liked humans, for some reason, and dreamed of experiencing their life. One day, he stopped some wolves attacking a merchant that was going through the forest, in exchange the merchant hired the treant in his shop. He's pretty terrible: goofy, slow and destructive, often breaking things when he moves his branches around, but he's trying and slowly improving.", "The alley - There is a back alley in the shadiest part of town, in it, you'll find an even smaller alley, barely large enough for one person, nestled between tall houses. It's dark and damp, hard to breath. Go there at midnight, place a bag full of god at the very end of the alley, with a note saying what you item you need. Then, take a knife, cut yourself and drop some blood on the street stones. At midday the next day, if the gold was enough, you will find what you wanted in the same place. If it wasn't, you'll find a severed pig head, with a similar but not-quite-the-same item in its mouth. ", 
        "The cleric of the god of lies - Apparently a normal shop with a very friendly and generous owner, this place is built above a temple to the trickster god, and the shopkeeper its cleric. Every item sold here has a drawback: potions are mislabelled, many items are cursed, armours have holes or missing parts. Their rope is too short, their lanterns give out bright pink light, their thieves tools always break, their backpack is always wet and ruins what's in it. Their blankets make you itch etc. They do it just to mess with people, for fun. If caught, they will say they have been cursed and send the players on a fool's errand to remove it, while they run away. ", 
        "The barbarian - This store is owned by a violent barbarian that wants gold to buy food and booze. He has no concept of personal space and is very touchy, if a client asks for a 'lame' item he'll laugh and offer something else, if the client looks like a nerd (mage) he'll make fun of them. He likes bartering, but has no interest in items that seem weak or unworthy of a warrior, and will handle them very roughly. Don't sell anything made of glass to him, he'll just throw it at you laughing.

Some have tried going inside, they all came back but couldn't remember what was there. ", "The bog - There is an isolated bog, not too far from town. Make the correct signal at night and from the tar a whole shop will emerge. It's a black market store, with many rare and illegal items, that magically hides inside the bog for safety. The people working in it are all slender humanoid frogs with a lucid black skin.", "The paranoid - There is a store hidden by a 3 meters tall wall, it has no visible windows, only a steel door. Inside, you'll find yourself in a completely empty room with only a chair and another metal door with a hole in it. The owner is extremely paranoic and mysterious. Only one person can go in the store at once, has to sit on the chair and ask what they want. The shopkeeper will talk to them from behind the door, and procure the item they want. The gold must be put on a tray that goes under the door, and the item will be dropped from the slit in the door. The buyer never sees the owner, any attempt to enter or spy on them with magic will find it's extremely hard.

Clients will see strange, evanescent figures moving around: those are reflections of people in the other stores. They will see a haze around the owner, he will look blurry and stretched.

Saying anything could cause a paradox, so they can't, but they can still sell them things.

        "The involuntary shopkeeper - This guy hates his own job more than anything, all he really wants is to sit behind the counter with his bottle of wine and smoke his pipe, not being bothered by anyone, especially not customers. He runs a shop with adventuring gear; winter clothes, magical trinkets, potions, rope and stuff like that. More focus on the magical stuff than anything else. The fact that the shop specializes in adventuring gear isn't by chance, our dear shopkeeper chose the business he guessed had the least amount of customers, so he wouldn't be bothered so much. He can abide what he considers 'real' adventurers as customers, but only just. Selling stuff means he has to restock, and that is such a pain. When the party first meet him, his shop is almost empty, and the few items that are still on the shelves are strewn about in a rather disorderly fashion. He's exhausted and annoyed, and almost chases them out again the moment they step in the door. The problem is that the nobles in the city has decided that adventuring, and especially adventuring gear(less danger than real adventuring), is all the rage at the moment. As the only shop that specializes in this kind of stuff, everyone who thinks they are something in town has been by and emptied him out. He might even consider giving the party some serious discounts in the future, if they could get adventuring firmly out of fashion again...",
        "The Prancing Kobold - When entering the shop, it quickly becomes apparent that half of this shop is a gigantic steel cage. In the middle of that cage is a relatively large pile of gold (knee high on a regular human). On top of that gold is a Red Scaled Kobold. Fiercely protective of his horde and possessions, he had the shop built around his horde so that no one could ever steal it. There's a person sized area where a series of complicated doors can allow the exchange of large items. To open the doors, the kobold must disable several traps using levers on his side of the of the room. He will never allow anyone into the cage and tries to never leave it. He will attempt to get the players to bring him a live chicken by paying them up to 10 gold. He will then ravenously consume the chicken.", "She's everyones grandmother - The big jerk barbarian? 'Sweety I really wish you would chew with your mouth closed, you know better' The angsty rogue? 'Oh deary, why do you wear so much black? I really wish you would wear more color, you have such a lovely smile' (Maybe she's knitted him a scarf next time they show up). The Wizard? 'Oh my, that was a lovely trick' or maybe he tries to show her some magic that will help around the house, and it's like teaching your grandmother how to use her computer. The drunk in the group? 'Its not my place to say, but I feel you're letting yourself down. I'll put the kettle on, you sit by the fire and try to rest' She wants to feed them, and won't take no for an answer. She will subtly suggest that areas of her property are in disrepair, and that they should assist her with chores, which invites more interaction. The idea here is to disarm your players, so no matter how much of a dick they are, they treat her like they would their grandmother. (No swearing, wipe their feet, make her proud, etc.)", 
        "The Alchemist - Every alchemy shop in the world leads into a pocket dimension run by a gnome alchemist. If pressed for his name he just says 'Al' or 'The Alchemist.' The players are the only people who get sent to the pocket dimension when they enter an alchemy shop--for the rest of the world this place doesn't exist. Al is prescient and likes to tease the players, they're close friends who have been to his shop on many occasions, after all, even if it's the first visit for the players themselves. He doesn't really sell anything so much as he gives out free samples, of which he always has exactly one ready. Al's potions are a bit weird. They have a label and always do exactly what the label says. Unfortunately, as they're experimental samples, the labels are a bit vague. An example: The Red Potion, *if you drink it, something will die. * Basically it gives my players some fun wacky items to use that I don't even know what they'll do until they get consumed. I usually have them do specific things based on the context of the situation they're getting used in and try to favor word play as much as practical effects.", "Pit fiends plaza - When the players ask for directions to a store, they all get directed to a building that looks like it got bombed in the blitz, and only the door is standing. Opening the door reveals a circular room with racks and shelves packed full with oddities and magic items galore. At the counter is a cheery imp who serves the devil lord mammon and a lesser devil who works as his intern. When the players purchase anything from the store, the imp will tell them the fate of the last adventurer to wield the item and what they paid to get it. He will then offer to trade the item for a contract: he gets all your things when you die and your soul works for mammon in the afterlife. Very few people take this offer, but there are some immensely powerful artifacts in his possession that he will only part ways with if you make the deal", 
        "The Shop that Sells Itself - A store of mundane gear with no shopkeeper to be found. A sign on the front door says 'Back In A Few Days, Come Right In!', and the place is apparently open 24/7. The owner is a wizard who takes long forays into adventuring (maybe he's just gone right now and will be back later, or maybe gone for good). Either way, the shop is magically enchanted to grant a sort of semi-sentience to the objects for sale so that they can sell themselves. Signs underneath each item list a price and instructions to leave the money in the object's place. Coils of rope will go on long spiels about how durable and plaint they are. Earthenware pots make strong appeals about the beauty in their own symmetry. Candles describe the exact amount of time they'll burn, and offer helpful snuffing advice. If an item is bought and paid for, the money placed in its stead is swallowed up by a mysterious void, and the item becomes inert/mundane. If an item is taken without paying, well let's just say that the objects in the store make very accurate witnesses for the local magistrate's prosecution case.",
        "The teleporting shack - This shack will seem to appear in the most random places. Sometimes it will be in the middle of a field, a dungeon or delicately balanced on the statue in the city centre. The shop keeper is constantly preoccupied; frantically running around the shop gathering all sorts of magical items from piles of unorganised goods, and taking them into the next room. He comes across a little loony and obsessed, this is perhaps because he is. He’s busy trying to perfect his homemade teleportation device, and it’s all he can think of... As he’s so busy, getting the shop keepers attention for more than a minute can prove challenging. It’s easier to just take what you came for, if you can find it that is. Unless you have to go digging through junk to find it he probably won’t notice, but if he does I hope you’ve always secretly dreamed of being a pig.", "A warlock multi-level marketing scheme - Some extraplanar being made a deal with a warlock, and told them to extend the pack for others. They use abilities given by their patron to provide some good or service that is harder to get otherwise. Maybe the fey MLM provides a supply of rare feywild fruits, or they offer to guide people through a forest faster than usual using fey shortcuts. Maybe the great old one warlocks are booksellers. Their primary goal is collecting knowledge from people, but they make their money by making and copying books. They deal in knowledge and secrets. These different groups of warlocks make deals with normal humans. The person sells their soul/energy to the warlocks above them. Those above keep gaining power. Their patron gains the most, of course.", 
        "Okail and Halite's Enchantments - A magic items shop run by a female kobold (Halite) and a male gnome (Okail). Halite's the sort that acts gruff to cover her caring streak, and wants things done 'properly' (again, because she cares that it's done right.). Think 'the one halfway nice and helpful lady at the DMV' and you're on the right track. Okail's the quietly cranky guy that lights up like a little kid when you get him talking about his interests, and is constantly trying to find 'better' ways to do things without explaining to anyone else what he's doing or why until Halite yells at him for it. The two put up a clearly forced front of polite friendliness to potential customers while bickering and snarking at each other...when they aren't finishing each other's sentences, that is. They also agree on the fact that getting to work on interesting orders is fun and making money is even better. The shop has a huge selection of items in the back room, retrieving any of them involves much yelling back and forth about where things are located and why, sounds of large objects being moved around, and occasional personal injuries. (Halite subtly resents when they go through this process and have to put things back.) It is gradually hinted that the two are married ('My mother warned me about mammals, but no, I was in love...' etc) and that hatchlings are involved. Neither will acknowledge any questions on this matter, further pursuit of such inquiry might find one's enchanted items displaying unusual quirks.", "The catfolk archivist with insanely high stealth skill who tolerates exactly zero shenanigans in her spell shop.

        "Gaiman Nancy's Always Open book shop and supplies - I made a shop where there is one in many towns and all big cities. The shops are even in unlikely places like Skullport. They are small book shops with amazing amounts of lore. They also sell some spell casting supplies like incense, foci, and paper. Each shop is small and filled with piled books. The shops are open 24 hours a day, 10 days a week. On entry, the shopkeeper is never there, but if they ring a bell the shopkeeper comes. The shopkeeper never leaves the store and often asks for the PCs to run errands for them outside the bookstore. Each shopkeeper is different, and quirky, and they all claim to work for Gaima Nancy. In truth, there is only one shop and only one shopkeeper. Their name is Gaima Nancy and they are a very powerful wizard Changeling. They attempted to use Wish to allow them to have Mordekainen's Magnificent Mansion with doors opening in multiple locations. The spell worked, but had side effects. The Mansion doors can be opened in multiple locations via a ritual spell cast in that location. However Gaima Nancy can no longer leave and he can't close the doors. If the players can convince him, he can let them use the store to travel from place to place, but only if they get to a high level.", "The dragon shop keeper - A clever dragon realized that they could make more money running a shop then from terrorizing the kingdom. They sell magic items from their horde to adventurers for a considerable profit. They are highly charismatic and will persuade adventurers to spend as much as their gold as possible.

        "Ren's In all of my open ended games, I have a wealthy and powerful family with the surname of Ren who own a string of franchises shops across the world in major cities and some large villages. Think like a Home Depot or a UHaul or whatever. All the shop types have different suffixes. Renoo’s Potions, Renai’s Horse Rentals, Renah’s Tavern and Beds, etc. Horse rentals have been pretty convenient. Rent a horse for a one way trip and return it to any Renai’s but make sure to feed them first before you return them or face a hefty fine. I sometimes have fun with this. When the players reach a high enough level, then Ren family uses the players as marketing material, kind of like Coca Cola sponsoring a race car — 'these guys trust Ren’s to get it done!' You could also make quests around the family. Maybe it turns out they are not as benevolent as they seem up front. Make a whole series of quests around how they use their influence to influence kingdom policy to their benefit to the detriment of the lower class, or whatever else. Or maybe their best items are actually stolen or looted from graveyards. Or maybe they want you to discreetly take out the competition.", "Although Shiny can't speak, she understands the concept of barter very well. A player may present a magic item they wish to trade, and if Shiny likes it she will rummage through her nest and produce a magic item that she is willing to give in return. If the player finds the offer acceptable, they can give their item to Shiny and she will let them take the other item. If the player doesn't like Shiny's offer, she might produce another item, or perhaps even offer an additional item if she really likes the player's item. However, after a couple of failed barter attempts Shiny will give up and stop bartering. Don't be afraid to have Shiny offer the players a bad deal at first, she is a magpie after all - they are cunning birds. Did the paladin fall down a bottomless pit? Did the entire party die while carrying the McGuffin? It's quite likely that the lost magic items wound up with Shiny somehow! Even if the characters don't know it, the players might find it cool that Shiny has the exact same Holy Avenger that the party's late paladin had carried. And it's a way for the players to retrieve lost useful items, even if it's a little bit videogamey.",

At the center of the room lies a jar full of blackness and glowing yellow eyes. When you open the jar, the creatures fly about, eventually settling, creating the illusion of a humanoid cloaked in turquoise. If you tell them what you want, they will respond with an ominous chorus of voices saying the required gold amount. They take them gold, put it in the jar, and produce said item from within the cloak. They be Many.

The players will often find her in marketplaces in her small tent, though the interior is about two to three times the size it should be. She of course sells a plethora of magical items that she has bought to resell or created herself. She deals in gold as with most merchants, but some items can only be paid for with souls (or one can offer to trade a soul for other items). The player can sell theirs for her to collect upon their death, but ideally they will agree to a deal she offers: when they have subdued someone and are willing to use their soul to pay Helcynth, they only need read a fiendish word written on a small ticket she will give the players, and she will appear to finish off and collect the soul from the subdued person. The offering will need to be wholly defeated but not dead (unconscious or captured at very low HP), and she will not fight with the party for a soul. This character bends the rules a bit and takes some liberties with night hag lore because it’s from a homebrew setting, but hey, she worked great for my game, even if my players ended up reneging on their deal with her and started a whole tangential arc where they had to invade her pocket dimension and kill her.",

Now, the wizard is kept prisoner in his ancient tower, kept in check by arcane magic and the fortress built around the tower, not to keep people out, but to keep him in. As per terms to his imprisonment, he must sell all of his scrolls, magic items, and potions. His prices are extremely high, of course, as it is quite expensive to keep this powerful arcane user's magic in check. Oh, and he is quite insane from centuries of isolation. Sidebar: It is fun to role-play animosity between the now insane shopkeeper and the warden. Also interesting to watch how the players interact with one who once performed evil acts, but is now on the path to redemption... or is he?", "Izzet Shopenator 3000 (prototype) - An izzet inventor has tried to make an automated shop. At the counter there are several tubes, speak the desired item into one of these tubes and they will fly down the tube to the customer, sometimes breaking the tube, making the item fly out of the side, and sometimes delivering the wrong item that almost sounds alike. When the item has been delivered the amount of money written on the item must be put into the tube, where it will suck up the cash, sometimes getting the customers arm caught as well. If the item is removed from the tube without delivery of payment, the item will explode.

Lights are aways out, so no one ever knows when it's actually open, but you can aways try the door. Inside, it's a rather well kept shop, and everything looks normal at First glance - except there's a Gnoll behind the balcony. The Gnoll is old and snorts while talking. He gives players discounts for bringing in more people, and is quite gulliable. The nice thing about him is that he is aways hungry, and new food makes him REALLY happy. He also makes remarks now and them about How tasty players look, and tells them about his memories eating members from the player's race. Apparently he got tired of killing to satiate his god's hunger, and is trying to do It by raising money.", 
        "The Quest Hook - The party comes across a kid running a store. He’s very eager and enthusiastic, happy to show the party all the quirky magical items he has for sale. He apologizes that there’s only so much he can sell because Daddy told him he can’t sell the more dangerous/powerful items. When probed for more information, the party learns that Daddy has been missing for over a month. The kid and his dad usually scout/adventure together and bring the loot back to the store, but this time Daddy heard of a high-risk, high-reward place, so he went ahead and told the kid to run the shop. Only, the kid is getting worried about Daddy... This works great as 1) a way to tell adventurers about where to find loot 2) a way to explain why the party can’t yet get powerful magic items 3) a motivation to get loot (from the place and from the shop) and 4) an emotional/protective motivation for characters not solely motivated by greed. I used it as a quest hook into The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan, and it worked pretty well. Also worth noting, I made the characters a kid and his dad, but gender isn’t important here so feel free to switch that up if you like.", "Discount Magic Goods Store - The store is run by an extremely aloof, airheaded wizard. He talks as if he's in a dreamy haze and moves with grand flourishes. If you ask him for a magic item he has it in every size, shape, colour or material you could dream of. Want Boots of Jumping? He's got it. Don't like that one? How about this one? How about this one? Maybe this one? If you ask he assures you yes, they are all Boots of Jumping. And they're all at 75% off too! Artifacts? Oh boy he's got artifacts. He's even got all 30 Eyes of Vecna! The joke is the guy got his hands on a staff that allows him to enchant any item, however he wants, 5 times per day but there's a 95% chance the item's going to become cursed and it puts a drain on his sanity. There's various odds of how badly cursed the items end up being and it's all a gamble for what the players are going to get if they buy anything. The Boots of Jumping could be anywhere from making Mario jump sound effects to making it so you can only move by jumping to making it so you can't jump at all.

A rather large and motley crow sits upon a busted crate. At the base of the crate an alley cat, accompanied by a scraggly litter of kittens, approaches the crow and drops what looks to be a shiny piece rubbish. You look on as both the cat and the crow seem to converse, the low cawing of the crow meeting the desperate meows of the cat. Eventually some sort of accord seems to be struck, and the crow produces a large half eaten fish, dragging it from the crate and letting it plop down on the dirty ground bellow. Immediately the mother alley cat picks up the fish and darts off, her kittens tumbling along behind her. Those who wish to stay and observe the crow for longer will discover that all manner of strays, ferals and other wild denizens of the alleys approach the crow throughout the day, including one or two beggars and street kids. Each time something shiny is produced, and an item from the box given. Sometimes food, sometimes junk, and at one point even a dagger (given to a street kid) is pulled from the crate. At sundown several more crows gather at the spot in the alley and begin to fuss around the crate. Eventually they all take flight, labouring under a sack clearly laden with goods. They cary the sack high above the roof tops, eventually disappearing from sight, their mysterious trade having officially closed for the day.",

You don’t want a single pet, you want to adopt a whole family.’ Finally he gets to one animal and says ‘Eh? This one looks good to you? Excellent!’ He then picks them up out of the cage, hands them to the person – again, regardless of whatever the person is saying – and then says ‘Now there is just the little matter of payment …’. Which is when the animal bites or claws the person and then gives the store owner a single drop of blood. Because he doesn’t sell pets to people, he sells people to pets.",
