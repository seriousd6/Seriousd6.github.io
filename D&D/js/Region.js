A strong personality cult surrounds them, as they skillfully portray themselves as all-powerful and beyond reproach. They answer to no one, evading any form of accountability and silencing those who dare question their authority. The rule of these leaders is centralized, with power tightly clutched in their hands, and any dissenting voices or rival political figures are swiftly silenced or eliminated. Manipulation of information is their art, as they control the flow of information and employ propaganda to mold public perception and maintain a carefully crafted image. Exploiting nationalism, they play on patriotic sentiments to rally unyielding support and loyalty from the population. Fear becomes their ally, as they skillfully utilize it to justify their actions, solidify their dominance, and ensure their rule remains unchallenged.",
