/*
Envelope: The large outer body of the airship that contains the lifting gas (usually helium or hydrogen). This component could inspire designs for solar or thermodynamic energy capture, given its large surface area.
Gondola: The compartment hanging below the envelope where the crew and passengers are housed. It might be an interesting point to consider for housing the generator itself or related machinery.
Engines: These are usually situated outside the gondola and provide thrust to move the airship. Energy could be generated from the heat or motion produced by these engines.
Ballast: Weights used to balance the airship and control its altitude. A generator could be designed around the idea of potential and kinetic energy, similar to a gravity battery.
Gas cells: Internal compartments within the envelope that contain the lifting gas. These could inspire designs involving gas pressure or gas-based energy storage.
Fins/Rudders: Vertical and horizontal stabilizers on the tail of the airship for control. These surfaces could be used for solar capture, or their movement could be harnessed for energy.
Rigging: The structural framework and ropes that hold the gondola to the envelope and provide structural integrity. Vibrations or movements in this rigging could potentially be harnessed.
Mooring mast: The tall tower used to anchor an airship when it's on the ground. It might inspire ideas for a vertical generator or act as a conduit for transferring energy.
Solar Panels: Modern airships could incorporate solar panels on the top of the envelope to harness solar energy.
Propellers: If the airship has them, they can produce mechanical energy that could be converted.
