She takes you to one of the rooms, and as you are making out, you notice that you are not in a room anymore.`, `You are a member of a movie club, where you guys go and see obscure, unnoticed movies and review them.

In spite of all of your objections, one party member, who claims to be very good at 'orienteering' (whatever that is), convinces the party to take a shortcut through the unmapped woods. Even though you have been traveling in a straight line for two hours, you realize you have circled back.`, `You throw a coin into a well, but are startled by a black cat. You trip and fall into the well, splashing into the water below, but cannot swim back to the surface of the water.

You look up and the water is gone, replaced by a ring of sparkling trees all around you.`, `Trixie flowers (twin soul flowers in elvish because they exist on both sides), so called for there mutating color.

Or maybe that came from the sudden sunlight? `,

As you continue on, familiar scenery gives way to fantastic foliage.`, `An archfey has been visiting the same town in disguise for centuries, gambling at a cozy tavern for fun. An old man has waited 70 years to win back a ring he foolishly gambled away, and his dedication impressed the archfey so much, he got it back with an enchantment. He, and each of his descendents, could use it to travel to and from the Feywild once in their life.`, `An image of an alluring and irresistable person appears, luring you deeper into the woods until you end up lost in the feywild, lured there by an avatar of a fey. `, `Against your better judgement, you decided to give the gnome's "magic powder" a try. `, `You try to open a door that you didn't realize was already open and end up in the Feywild.`, `This book is very well written.

You walk towards the circle to get a better look. You look up and notice on the other side of the clearing in the shadows there is a figure, eyes shining. You didn't realize, but part of your body has crossed into the circle. You're falling.`,

At some point the beings disappear, you wake up exhausted.`, `You intentionally took some drugs that were supposed to allow you to see into the fey wild temporarily, but the duration time has passed and you don’t seem to be coming down. `, `You performed a ritual to summon a Fae. Well, you got Fae but they weren't summoned. `, `Too much sex in the sacred Eladrin grove! Grotesque horny mortals, mating twice in a year! Sometimes, ugh... more!`, `Not enough sex in the sacred nymph grove!

No hokey magic, mysterious mist, swarm of leaves or anything else just, you turn left at just the right spot and now there is a satyr who just stopped playing his pipe to a grove of nymphs to stare at your confused self.`, `You notice a plain worn down wooden gate placed in the middle of a meadow. It is just a gate without any fence or signs that their used to be one. You jokingly open the gate and walk through it ending up in the Feywild.`, `As you are walking through the forest you notice a large rune stone that is a different coloured stone than those around it. When you go up to investigate it a cloud of darkness erupts from the stone and everyone is swept up by it. When the darkness disperses you find yourself in a quarry made of the same kind of stone as the rune stone.`, `Something spooks your mounts/pack mules and they race off causing everyone to pass through a strange distortion in the air. (reroll if you do not have any mounts or pack mules)`, `Suddenly the baying of giant hounds echo through the air and day becomes twilight. The sound strikes fear into everyone as the baying gets louder and hoof beats join in. You find yourself on the run from the wild hunt!`

        `The Dancing Grove- A grove where entering causes people to hear lovely music`, `Glittering Lake- Looking into this lake will not show a reflection of the user, but rather a version of them with random features of a fae creature`, `Fairy Causeway- A causeway where the rocks seem to gather faires at night`, `Cave of Displacement- One entering this cave during full moons may cause them to suddenly teleport to a random town`, `Choking Mists- A swamp laid with permanent purple mist, which is said to cause people to hallucinate`, `The Timeless Forest: A place where no PC has a feeling for any sort of time movement and what space in time they are in. They won't know how many minutes, hours, days or weeks have past due to the beautiful twilight throughout this seemingly endless Grove between the trees. Between the trees there are pools of mist that when entered bring the PCs to another place in the fey, another time or even another plane altogether (blatantly stolen from "The Magician's Nephew"). Once they emerge from this place, the same applies: It'll be up to the DMs discretion on how much time has passed.`, `Firefly Coppice: This clearing of flora broken by a bioluminescent curiosity flickering in the dusk light of the Feywild, but while a casual glance may rest to weary eyes, a moment to longer can leave your defences down just staring at the dance of lights. Make a DC 15 Wisdom save to carry on to the other side of this thicket or simply walk around to avoid such hypnotic patterns.`, `The River lands: a huge river delta splits the land in to dozens of small islands. Simple bridges or stepping stones connect the islands but each crossing has a different magic quality that affect those that cross.`, 
        `The Great Oak: An oak tree so huge that it stands a mile high with a trunk 500 yards wide. It is home to strange plant monstrosities and gargantuan insects. There are some people that have made there homes there but they are mostly hermits.`, `The Sunshine Acre: An area of giant flower heads bathed in extreme sun light. Creatures not taking shade take radiant damage. Giant bumble Bees can be found here.`, `The Weerily Well - This old stone well can be stumbled onto about midway through a journey into the feywild. It looks like a wishing well you could find on the material plane, in fact, the four gravel roads that branch off of it but abruptly end after a few feet imply that maybe it once was...Through the still, clear water players can see that the bottom of the well is glimmering with coins, though unbeknownst to them that water is the home of a water weird. If they players toss a coin in the water, the weird will reveal itself, thanking them for their kindness and confessing that it longs to hear of the outside world. It is willing to trade information: news of the outside world, for old histories or warnings of the nearby feywild dangers.`, `The Withering Palace - The palace of Arch-fey who let it fall into disrepair after having their heart broken, letting it sink into the ground (in my world, the Unseelie side on the underside of the feywild and is literally pulling the Seelie side over so things left unattended for too long sink into the ground before emerging on the dark side of the world). The entrance is guarded by the Creeping Gardens, but if you go beneath the surface you may find many things: the Hall of Mirrors, the Quiet Room, and the souls of the servants abandoned along with the palace. It appears that you might have been able to make it past the gardens, but others weren’t so fortunate.`, 
        `The Twelve Whispers of the Winds: Adventurers traversing through the valley of an immense mountain range may find themselves hearing etherial voices whispering in their ears. The tricky part is that each person hears something different with only one unifying factor: the messages are twelve words long.`, `Glade of Wistful Willows - Several beautiful green willows cascade down to almost soft, grassy ground. If you enter, you must succeed in a WIS Save (DC 15) or fall into a deep, restful sleep under a willow tree. Once someone is a asleep the hanging vines attempt to grapple the sleeping folk (Dex+Athletics 16) to attempt to pull them up to consume them.`, `Hedge Maze - once entered, 4 successful Int + Survival DC 16 are needed to leave. Time is not typical inside the maze. Upon exit the party finds that it is ${searchArray(['2 minutes before they enter','the exact same time as when they entered','2 minutes after they entered','1 hour after they entered','2 hours after they entered','1 day after they entered'])}.`, `Ruined wall - there is decrepit wall with odd symbols carved upon it. Upon inspection, succeed on a investigation check, DC 16. Success reveals the symbols are gibberish, failure youn are affected as if targeted by a successful Confusion spell.`, `Hospitable Hot Springs. Lovely and inviting hot springs. Shale stone houses several pools of hot water which glows faintly golden. Soaking in the waters for 1 hour removes all levels of exhaustion. This effect cannot be repeated for 1 year.`, `Cupcake soil - the ground before you is covered in candy sprinkles. Upon entering, treat as quicksand.`, 
        `Ephemeral Garden - a gorgeous formal rose garden is before you. Any attempt to interact with the blooms, the garden dissipates into smoke an the person who interacted is poisoned for D6+1 hours, even if they are immune to poison.`, `The Mushroom Ring. Everyone knows that a mushroom ring in the Material Plane can serve as a temporary one way door TO the Feywild if the moon is in the phase. So where does this ring of gigantic toadstools lead to? And what triggers it?`, `Stranglers Copse - a heavily overgrown woods, rife with Assassin Vine, Shambling by Mounds, and Chokers.`, `The Grove of Power - a completely normal grove of otherwise unremarkable trees. Set up as a literal tourist trap by a group of surprisingly market savvy Redcaps in an effort to lure visitors to the Feywild to a gruesome and bloody death. `, `The Archfey’s Field - This seemingly ordinary field is under the constant watch and purview of a powerful Archfey. The Archfey is very particular about who is able to traverse his precious field, and actively seeks to antagonize those who step afoot without his blessing. Unfortunately, this field is known to be a hotspot of extra-planar teleportation. Many adventuring parties will find themselves in a clean open field with only a small wooden sign saying “Do Not Step On The Grass.” and an odd feeling of being watched.`, 
        `Giant's Grove - a forest of sequoia trees, ferny underbrush, and immense prehistoric-sized butterflies and beetles.`, `Rainbow Wastes - a misty, crumbling mesa, its stripes made of vivid colors of rock not found in other planes and with a higher-than-usual concentration of precious and semiprecious gems. Its extreme temperature fluctuations and its native fauna make it a challenge for profitable mining.`, `Firefly Fields - miles and miles of tall grassy fields that, in the night, begin to glow from the grasses' faint bioluminescent tips.`, `Battlegrounds - at the site of a long-ago battle, the magic made the ground barren and too sandy to grow much of anything. An archaeological dig site might be here to find ancient weaponry and bones, but due to the long lives of eladrin, a family still visits a recent ancestor's grave here.`, `The Moonwell: said to be the only sighting of a moon found in the Feywild's consistent dusk/dawn. As a DM, use the Moonwell as a teleport to wherever you like; a deep well that when looked upon, shimmers with a likeness of a full moon, upon diving in, players fall through the waters as if softly falling through air and find themselves elsewhere within the Feywild with no visible path back.`, 
        `Fortress of the Lost: The entrance to this fortress never appears in the same place twice. People find the gold-bounded double doors whenever they are truly lost in the Fry realms. Once they enter, they will be unable to find their way out to the original location. If they find an exit in its maze-like depths, it will be far from where they entered. However, whether it is far in time or space, depends on the exit they choose.`, `The starlit woods. The “stars” are magical lights almost like will o’ wisps- or perhaps they are will o’ wisps that report back to the Archfey who lives there.`, `The Living Tree - a village woven into the interior of a tree trunk that's hundreds of feet wide and almost 1000 feet tall. Residents include faerie dragons, a pack of blink dogs, some eladrin families, and, oddly enough, a ghoul that none of the residents seem to acknowledge.`, `The Valley of Honey. Guarded bu the Bear king, this flower covered field houses the best bee hives and mastery in all the Feywild. Come enjoy the drink and revelry put on by the Bearguard. Hunts, fishing and drinking and eating competitions as well as feats of strength and song for the ages to compete to sit at the table of the Bear King. Careful though, when Winter's Queen comes to visit, and the Valley goes dark and the leaves change colors, the Bearguard may just want to keep you for a winter snack...`
