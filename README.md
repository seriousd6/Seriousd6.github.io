I have begun storing a few future NFT examples on here, this is a makeshit gallery until I get funding to host somewhere else more secure. Look for the "NFTs" folder above

# Resuming 11/1/21
I have a rekindled desire to continue work on this site, I will be make incremental progress each month, please message me on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/seriousd6/) to share ideas and make comments!

# Project Goal
My goal for this project was to take all of the wonderful lists and tables created by other redditors and create a simple, modular, and inspiring tool for myself (to learn how to code as well as how to DM better), and for othersto use as well!

The vast majority of content is from the reddit D&D community - Credit for the creativity and ideas goes to them! I used javascript to collect and make the static ideas and tables I found there live and usable here!
