# Statement of Pause 3/6/21
I have achieved the major goal for this site and incremental updates may be possible in the future but I am now working on new projects and am not planning any more major updates!

# Project Goal
My goal for this project was to take all of the wonderful lists and tables created by other redditors and create a simple, modular, and inspiring tool for myself (to learn how to code as well as how to DM better), and others!

The vast majority of content is from the reddit D&D community - Credit for the creativity and ideas goes to them! I used javascript to collect and make the static ideas and tables I found there live and usable here! 

Character names are from www.fantasynamegenerator.com
