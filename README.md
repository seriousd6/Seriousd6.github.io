# Project Goal
My goal for this project was to take all of the wonderful lists and tables created by other redditors and create a simple, modular, and inspiring tool for myself (to learn how to code as well as how to DM better), and others!

The vast majority of content is from the reddit D&D community - Credit for the creativity any ideas goes to them! I used javascript to collect and make the static ideas and tables I found there live and usable here! 

# Outside Content Sources
Shopkeeper inventory data is from Walrock Homebrew - At time of use it is a free download from DM's Guild - Please let me know if it stopped being free!

Character Names are from www.fantasynamegenerator.com
