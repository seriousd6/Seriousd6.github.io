If they succeed on the save they still visibly hesitate. The spell breaks after three failed attempts.", "Poppet Pal, which requires a little bread man be baked as a material component.

For 1d6 rounds, any damage dealt within that radius is non-lethal damage.", "Mutual Stasis, caster touches target to lock them both in space and time. Caster and target become immovable and invulnerable, unaware and unable to act for 1d6 rounds.", "Strangler Wig, causes its target’s head hair to grow into a noose, attach to the nearest anchorable surface, and then start suffocating them. If the hair is cut the spell stops working. Doesn’t work on targets without hair on their head.",

Their symbol on their shields is a beautiful lady.", "The Order of the Genociders (Motto-Kill them all-God Will Know Their Own.)

This Order likes to take prisoners for ransom, either in the joust or the tourney or on the battlefield, and fight with clubs, blunted swords and blunted lances. Because they can make a lot of money This way, they are one of the richest of the knightly Orders even by the standards of the nobility. Their symbol on their shields is a set of handcuffs.", "The Order of the Stars (Motto-Heal and Cure All.) These knights are healers and because they heal both sides equally and don't take prisoners, only fighting in self defense of themselves or the wounded, they are rarely killed on the battlefield or even taken as prisoners by either side in a war.Their symbol on their shields is a red cross on a white background.", "The Order of the Long Hand (Motto-I see you.) This knightly Order officially operates on the side of law and order within the kingdom, but there are rumors that it kidnaps or murders the king's enemies who are living abroad and also acts as a foreign intelligence network. The symbol on their shields is a grasping hand.", "The Order of the Silver Sails (Motto-A life on the ocean waves.)Members of This order spend half of the year at sea as naval officers, and specialize in fighting effectively at sea, seamanship and navigation, as well as the search for new lands.

This Order fights the dark elves, goblins, giant spiders, giant centipedes and other denizens of the caves and tunnels of the kingdom, driving them back without mercy and taking their treasure. Their shields are jet black.", "The Golden Order (Motto-Money, money, money) These knights have made a lot of money through trading, loaning out money, and land ownership, and it is rumored that they all cheat on their taxes.

The peddler is actually a spy travelling under cover and the wagon was deliberately stuck to provide an excuse to make contact.

They offer the party a chance to buy their wares and show them the collection of arms and armor in the cart; all used, some very obviously, with dented armor, nicked blades and blood stains. There are a few good pieces and at a good price. If there are any magical items, the vendors are unaware of this and sell them as standard. These characters make good money from looting battlefields, most of this haul from a recent clash between two nobles’ armies.
