    Guilds
        "Ibian Jiraiya (Vampire Hunters): The Ibians are frog or salamander-like humanoids from another dimension or universe who have held a single colony, the city of Ib in the land of Mnar, for at least ten thousand years. Their soldiers, the Jiraiya, are known for being completely silent, and for mastering water magics. Their water magics make them uniquely suited to vampire slaying, as vampires are vulnerable when submerged in water.", "Holy Maiden (Vampire Hunters): Ibian golems, designed as the ultimate Vampire Slayers. Made of an exotic marble-like material, they appear as ornate iron maidens with an uncanny smile on their face, which turns into a laughing scream, projecting beams of holy light (which may also be Mu / Null energy or the projection of a white hole). When they strain themselves, they shed tears of blood. They have the intelligence of a golem, or sometimes an angel or ghost from heaven. They are powered by a vampire, trapped in a hibernating state as if in a coffin, needles draining their blood to power the maiden. An operator must occasionally blood-let into the maiden to keep the vampire alive. A more powerful vampire yields a more powerful maiden, but requires more blood, a more sophisticated operating system, and is more likely to go berserk. If a maiden is on the verge of going berserk, it will try to pulp the vampire inside for one final, explosive burst of holy light.", "Ibian Dhampir (Vampire Hunters): Half-vampire, half-ibian. Ibian dhampirs are unique in that they have absolutely no vulnerability to being submerged in water, in addition to being less vulnerable to the other weaknesses of vampires. Additionally, their vampiric powers operate on lunar phases, being virtually mortal on a new, crescent, or quarter moon, and nearly equal to a full vampire during a gibbous or full moon. Even during this time, they maintain their immunity to water submersion.", "Vaporist (Dragon Hunters): Witch doctors, plague doctors, and other learned specialists. They gather or cultivate herbs, fungi, bacteria, and viruses which agitate the unique properties of dragon lungs and guts associated with their element-breathing biology. They collect these ingredients into mounds which they set afire, vapors rising up to the dragons, or compress them into pellets that can be ignited from firearms or set alight and launched from bows, cannons, and ballista. They are also trained in butchery and knifework, and often carry cutlery carved from dragon bone or an equally hard and sharp material. As the effects of the vapors kick in and the dragon falls to the ground, they position themselves to slice open the plummeting dragon across their bellies, leveraging the dragon's own force and velocity against it, spilling their guts which smash into the ground at high velocity.", "Blink Master (Dragon Hunters): Beastmasters with a specialty in training blink dogs. The dogs are trained to draw the attention of the dragon, or lie in wait to ambush a charging dragon. They herd it towards the highest ground they can find with the best cover, in an attempt to force the dragon to charge towards the ground. As the dragon charges or exhales its elemental payload, the blink dogs teleport-pounce up to the dragon, dodging the breath attack, and collectively work to immobilize the wings and bite and claw at the dragon's vulnerable points such as eyes, belly, and throat, blinking around the body as needed or off to safety as the dragon crashes to the ground. Some blink masters breed their blink dogs to be immune or resistant to specific elements, or to be empowered by certain elements, making them better suited to hunting specific kinds of elemental dragons. Some extremely high-level blink masters use (barely-)tamed hounds of tindalos rather than blink dogs.", "Dazzler (Beholder / Basilisk / Gorgon Hunters): In every way trained to disorient and disable vision. They wear jewelry of reflective glass, shiny clothing and armor, and lights, learn blinding spells and spells of flashing lights, or carry magic items or wands that do likewise. They use the beholder's many eyes against them, disabling their eye magics and making it difficult if not impossible for them to aim their disintegration rays.", "Sundancer (Beholder / Basilisk / Gorgon Hunters): They wear the skin of a displacer beast, carefully butchered to maintain its light-bending magical abilities against monsters. They dance through the disintegration rays of beholders; their position is always a foot or two away from the stare of a basilisk or gorgon. As the monsters look in vain, the sundancer dances ever closer, until it reaches close enough to lash at the monsters eyes with its weapons or the tentacles of the displacer beast skin.", "Soulbinder (Lich Hunters): Priests, clerics, and exorcists, who collect heaven-bound souls. Often, they sell indulgences to the poor, offering them a chance at heaven so long as they allow the soulbinder to borrow their soul for a time. Liches draw their necromantic powers from the nether-portal where their soul would be, instead safely stored in its phylactory. As they use their powers, the portal widens, and eventually it grows wide enough for the soulbinder to lodge a borrowed soul into it like a plug, significantly impairing the lich, and temporarily turning them into a mortal. If the lich is not killed quickly enough, the soul will be thrashed by the necromantic energies and the lich will be undead again. However, if it is killed in time, the new soul will block out the original soul held in the phylactory, at which point the under-used soul will quickly wither away, and the soulbinder may safely retrieve the borrowed soul.", "Dungeon Custodian (Dungeon Hunters): Consume alchemical concoctions containing, or naturally produce in their bodies, an enzyme that makes them immune to the acid of a gelatinous cube. They enter a cube, usually naked or with rare articles of clothing immune to the cube, and operate it from the inside, manipulating its simple intelligence towards the custodian's aims. They sweep through the dungeon in their cube, cleansing the dungeon of monsters. Custodians will often carry capsules containing condensed gelatinous cubes within them, to use in emergencies if the dungeon does not have any gelatinous cubes in it or their current cube is destroyed.", "Spiral King (Mind Flayer / Psionic Hunters): Master mesmerists and tacticians, their name a reference to the King from Chess, and the fact that they are powerful psychics whose psionics are fully dedicated to the construction and maintenance of their psionic mind castles, making them the ultimate anti-psychics. Any psionic attack traps the psychic in the Spiral King's mind castle, where the castle itself assaults them from all angles. Even as they try to escape, they find themselves in infinite spiral staircases, recursively looped like an MC Escher painting.", "Nightmare Wendigo (Mind Flayer / Psionic Hunters): When humans or certain other creatures dying of starvation succumb to cannibalism, they transform into wendigo; skeletal, bestial, white-skinned or white-furred, supernatural monsters of rage and consumption. When a psychic on the verge of brain-death cannibalizes the mind of one of their own, they may become a Nightmare Wendigo. They are stark-raving mad, but often functional. Their affect is unsettling and most others are uncomfortable around them, but otherwise they are capable of reason. However, when in the presence of psychic beings, and especially when a psychic being such as a Mind Flayer attempts to feed on their mind, their physical body transforms into a wendigo, and the wendigo's shadow ravages the mind of the psionic attacker.", "Noble Dhampir (Vampire Hunters): A lineage of dhampirs descending from the most powerful vampires and most exceptional humans, usually selectively bred but occasionally inducted. They are often bred or chosen for the strongest resistance to vampire weaknesses, greatest vampire abilities, restraint towards bloodlust, or other supernatural or exceptional mundane abilities. Those inducted into the Noble family are some of the most dangerous and powerful beings in the world, usually indoctrinated to hate vampires and their vampire heritage.", "Lightning Golem (Giant Hunters): These metal golems are built by artificers with special training, and are not magical in nature. Given the intricacy of the work, the knowledge necessary to maintain them, and the cost, they are rare. It ends up being more sensible to make a smaller number of massive lightning golems scaled to fight giants and kaiju than to make many smaller, human-sized or large lightning golems. The artificers either make a deal with, or capture a lightning elemental, and force it into circuits of usually copper, silver, or gold within the Lightning Golem, and through means not well understood, the elemental animates the golem. Often the artificer will build an electric-proof cage within the golem from which a pilot can (partially) control the elemental.", "Meta-Alchemist (Elemental Hunters): Everyone is familiar with the elements; Earth, Water, Fire, Air, but these are actually the outward expression of two deeper philosophical principles of cohesion and combustion. The meta-alchemists have, through deep thought, transcended the planes, and have access to the sulfuric hellfires and the mercurial ichor of the gods. With these elements, they can snuff flames, steady torrents, crumble the earth, and thin the air.", "Slinger Grenadier (Giant Hunters): These hunters are masters of the shepherd sling. Their slings are magically enchanted with haste or similar spells, allowing them to spin far faster, and launch farther and more powerfully, than would otherwise be possible. Depending on the size of the sling and bullet, it can shred enemy lines, leave explosive craters, and puncture giants and armored monsters. Even the weakest enchanted slings require great muscle strength and training to use effectively, and the most devastating slings are positioned in-place like artillery and operated by a team.", "Necroborg (Undead Hunters): These necromancers hone their abilities towards the integration of life and un-death. They blend blood and blight, wearing skeletal armors and integrating undead appendages and organs into themselves. Zombies bite, and necroborgs bite back. By ingesting undead tissue, or siphoning blight through claw-syringes integrated directly into their bloodstream, the necroborgs steal the eldritch energies of their undead foes, or turn them to their will.", "Necro-Demolitionist (Undead Hunters): Divine channelers who invoke a so-called deadman's switch suite of spells. They use a potent combination of abjure undead and turn undead to create a simultaneously pulling and pressing, violent force; an implosion followed by an explosion proportional to the number of undead compressed within it. Another spell they cast triggers as a fresh corpse is being blighted, blocking the eldritch energies partway through the transformation, causing an explosive necromantic pulse. If any other fresh corpses are also being blighted, the necromantic pulse blocks their blight, creating a chain reaction of corpse explosions and necromantic pulses.", "Zombie Rancher (Undead Hunters): Cowboys of the blight. They use carefully controlled divine spells to compel the migrations of lesser undead, usually skeletons and zombies. Often they are utilized merely to divert the path of an undead scourge like digging a trench to change the course of a river. Some kingdoms have reached a level of capital and industrialization that they have employed zombie ranchers who use their spells to create logic-gates from the zombies, turning scourges into un-living computers. Less advanced but sufficiently wealthy kingdoms instead divert scourges towards their enemies, but that is a dangerous game, as the scourge grows larger, and the number of zombie ranchers rarely grows in kind.", "Werehound (Werewolf Hunters): A 'breed' of werewolves, 'domesticated' (enslaved) for generations and bred to be the ultimate hunters. They have exceptional speed and sense of smell and are capable of keeping werewolves in their sights, or tracking their scent into the day, when they are at their most vulnerable. Except for when they bloodlust, their feral instincts are attenuated compared to werewolves, but they are formidable fighters in their own right, and are trained in group hunting tactics and to hunt with humans.", "Cold Iron Jack (Fey / Werewolf / Forest Hunters): Lumberjacks and huntsman equipped with tools of royally-enchanted cold iron. The cold iron is devastating to magical beings, especially those of the forest, such as fey and werewolves, and can give a lumberjack the strength to chop through a tree in a single blow and the will to laugh in the face of Darkness. The cold iron is only as powerful as the royalty, or more generally the civilization, that empowers it.", "The Knights of St. Gumbly (Giant Slayers): An order of mountain goat-riding halflings and children who specialize in the use of the javelin and grappling hook. As per the teachings of their founder they believe that giants are the embodiment of rapacious sin, and so slaying them while practicing strict temperance is their moral duty. Their preferred tactic is to climb up their targets’ bodies to strike their soft head bits.", "The Ash-Eater Lodge (Treant, Dryad, Druid, Etc. Slayers): Civilization’s hunger for fuel is always ravenous, yet the forests hold their bounty jealously. The rangers of the Ash-Eater Lodge wield their advanced knowledge of ecology as a weapon, collapsing predator populations, poisoning the earth, putting pockets of resistance to the torch, and otherwise softening the defenders of the woods for their harvest.", "Ironcrackers (Demon Slayers): Veterans of the campaign against iron-walled Dis, specializing in the use of occult siege weapons. Holy water cloudburst bombs, cannonballs of sacred salt, and horns of Jericho all number among their arsenal.", "Poor Unfortunate Souls (Witch Hunters): Pitiable and practically indispensable members of witch hunts. People who by accident of malefic influence of birth are lightning rods for curses, shielding their comrades from the same.",
        "The Salty Dogs: A mercenary guild that specializes in maritime activities. Crew for hire, protection of merchant vessels, dock security, etc. You can find a Salty Dogs guildhall in any city with a port.

Both fascinated by the good Doctor's music, calculations, and horrified by their disruptive magical ability; a small faction have gathered around the prodigy and a new guild of ritual magical discovery was formed! By day, the good doctor makes ends meet cleaning the halls of the magical college. At night, Dr Eosinophil and Company secretly are playing tasty licks in their band, and calibrating crystalline emitters, constructing Z-pinch constricting wards, and inverting VX-Thaumo Compensators to prevent excess Lamb shift.", "The Nameless Ones: A group entirely dedicated to doing good at any cost. They are not controlled by money, power, or authority. Their own structure is vague even to many members as they don’t wish anyone one person to control all.

Their ears are everywhere and their agents ready.", "Uncle Theo’s Awe Inspiring and Stupendous Cirque de Magi: Led by the illustrious Uncle Theo himself the Cirque travels from city to town to colony performing their amazing acts. Going once doesn’t do the show justice as they have so many acts and wonders to go on for days. Though in the underbelly of most cities people know them for different reasons. Heists and thefts of legend, work for nobles, and political assassinations are common jobs for members of the Cirque. Uncle Theo often claims not to know of any illicit work being done by any of his people and that if it was happening he would stop it. Whichever part of the Cirque de Magi you wish to see, go and watch a show for whatever reasons, over or under the table, you have.", "The Golden Antiqouram: A group entirely dedicated to the preservation and acquisition of ancient artifacts and items of historical significance. Making sure people have a past to look on is their main goal. They are open about their existence and while gaining membership can be difficult it is not impossible. Members must be able to make the decision of artifact over all else. Nothing is more important. Not wildlife, nor yourself, nor other people, or even civilization. Their only aim is to preserve.", "Eternity: A group entirely dedicated to finding the Philosopher’s Stone for their own evil and mysterious deeds. They are known of almost nowhere due to their merciless tactics to cover up their acts. Fear is the only way people know of them, brands and marks of a closed fist with light escaping through its fingers are the only thing to prove the groups existence. All else is story told by bards in brothels or even members themselves.", "The Drifting Wave: A group of sailors, privateers, navy men, and pirates dedicated to teaching and passing on ancient laws and secrets of the sea and even parts of history that must not be known. They are secret and do not wish to be openly known to the world for the ancient knowledge they contain is often hidden to make sure it does not flow freely into the hands of those that will make ill-use of it. They are everywhere and what they know encompasses everything.", "The Ordinals Guild: they’re the official measurers or distance, direction, and altitude. They survey all the territories near and far.", "Sprinting Beholder: A tavern full of oxymoronic creatures and furnishings. Owned by a 7 ft gnome the tavern attracts all sorts of odd ball types.

Whether it's a ruthless noble or a behind blocking a mountain pass, they will pay well to have it removed. Highly secretive, invitation is based on strange criteria. Assassins, mercenaries, clerics of good gods and simple turnip farmers can be among their order, with the leaders being incomprehensibly placed. A simple letter left beneath a pillow at the local inn is their advertisement, or a message tucked into a basket of apples their mission for you.

        "The Teddy: An ordinary nine year old girl. She's fine, but her beloved stuffed toy 'Thread-Bear' isn't. He's a sadistic, button-eyed monster who will kill anyone who tries to separate the two of them. A poisoned needle and thread is his weapon of choice.", "The Listener: This friendly innkeep is happy to let you run up a tab at her homely tavern. If you run out of money for ale or, why you can pay her in memories like you always do. Don't you remember?", "The Old Dears: An AA-style group of former 'mad wizards'. They seem like a normal old folk who meet weekly in the village hall. They're helpful to the point of creepiness. If you reject their friendship too many times, one of these old dears will snap.", "Spider Man: A famous barbarian, possibly of a friend of yours. Sadly, he died in debt to a community of intelligent spiders. His body has been repossessed by the spiders and they're using his body/reputation to pull off one last big heist. They're not bad creatures, but they desperately need the money.", "The Shadow: This person is oddly nondescript when you meet them, but slowly becomes more and more similar to one of your BBEG's. It's shaping itself to fit your fears.", "The Temple Beggar- A old man who sits at the front of a local temple. He begs for alms with a barely audible voice. At the end of the day, he walks into the temple and gives what he has earned to the donation box, blessing those who gave to him before vanishing until the next morning, where he will appear in his customary place. If harrassed, a random bestow curse is placed on the offender, though seemingly not cast by him.", "Tax Evader- A former nobleman who was ousted for not paying his taxes to the local lord. There is a bounty on his head that has never been collected. Attempts to catch him lead to failure as the spell he cast in an attempt to help him evade taxes by producing cooked books, instead helps him evade capture by teleporting him randomly when he sits still for too long.", "The Lucky farmers: the fields of this family grow especially Farge crops, and even in times of hardship produce plentiful food. They’ve actually become quite wealthy in recent years due to their great fortune. They’ve now purchased and oversee most farms in the area so that almost all of the food for the city comes from this family. After a wave of sickness overwhelms the city, investigation reveals that the family’s fortune has dark origins.", "The Runt of the Litter: The scrawny kid who always gets picked on in town because of his size. Both thinner and shorter than the average man, next to no one gives him the time of day. But one thing about this guy: he doesn't give up. He doesn't back down from a challenge, and he faces his bullies head on, especially when they bully others. Even when he gets knocked down lot, he stands up, brushes himself off, looks the perpetrators in the eye, and stands boldly against them. He can do this all day.", "The quarter master, at first seems to be a friendly blacksmith, but once he’s stolen from he’s revealed to be 1/4 of a powerful great old one, named the master.", "The stray hungry cat. A black cat that is weathered, old and hungry is found scrounging for scraps and clawing at passerby’s for any food. However, this cat is a black dragon in shapeshifter form. She rewards the first generous soul who gives her any food scraps with a treasure from her lair.", "An Old Man: A reference to the old saying, 'Never trust an old man in a young man's profession'. The Old Man works in a dangerous job (adventurer, mercenary, assassin), and is clearly a master of his craft, but his personality is twisted - a lack of trust-building, increasing odds of them 'dissappearing' at the first sign of trouble, and a clear selfish attitude towards the party. Might not be the ideal player character, but certainly a memorable NPC.", "The Farmer: A down on his luck man, forced into adventuring to find more fertile lands after his cabbage farm failed. Still, he's competent with a sword or magic blast, and even some healing magic. Every seed he plants seems to wither away, no matter how good the soil. In reality, this man is an unknowing warlock to an entity bent on telling stories of tragedy and suffering, and if he joins your party the players are likely to get wrapped up in the malevolent force plaguing the farmer.", "The old troll under the bridge: Seemingly a dumb old troll with a crooked neck, a hunched posture, and covered in mud and grime. However, he knows a lot more than what is shown on the surface. He spends his days collecting bones, lizards, and herbs by the river to brew up interesting concoctions. Some of these mysterious liquids have the potential to tell valuable fortunes and foresee great dangers.", "The Investigative Journalist: They outwardly come off as a young starry-eyed reporter that hasn't yet been exposed to the truth of the news industry. They talk about revealing dark secrets and changing the world with marvelous exposés. Despite their apparent inexperience, they have an amazing intuition on finding material for these articles, often knowing exactly where important events are taking place and having the skills to observe them complete unnoticed. (The Investigative Journalist is a level 13 Mastermind Rogue, has 18s in both Dexterity and Wisdom, and has double proficiency in Perception, Persuasion, and Investigation, along with normal proficiency in Stealth, History, and Deception.)", "The Hoarding Librarian: A quiet, elderly person, dressed in shabby clothes and having long matted hair. They sit in the corner and keep to themself. When people nearby them have a conversation about historical events, ancient civilizations, obscure magic, or things of a similar nature, their eyes light up with interest and passion. If addressed, they are willing to converse and seem quite interested in the players' adventures. If a good impression is made (usually over multiple meetings, and easily accomplishable as long as at least one person isn't being a hateful jerk), they will invite the players to their home. Their home is an old, sturdy bunker buried in the ground just outside of town. The bunker is ultimately the size of a standard inn, however none of that space is usable due to the very old books, papers, and journals spread in mountains throughout the entire bunker. It is impossible to step anywhere without stepping on something. The hoarder will let the players read anything they like, but requests they do not take anything out of the bunker. If the players are searching for a certain old, obscure book or a book on something ancient and/or obscure, it is there. If asked to find a book or paper, the hoarder will get immediately distracted with other found books. Using Locate Object will narrow down the search to a certain mass, but that mass still has to be searched through. The difficulty of finding a book or paper on a certain topic or by a certain author is detailed below: (Sorry for quality, I'm on mobile.)", "The Shaman. Living in the outskirts of town and essentially in the woods, this person is actually an incredibly powerful shaman who is able to raise nature spirits and bless areas to keep away corruption to his land, which is actually an ancient burial ground. He seems to keep to himself, most of the time, but those who do evil should certainly beware.", "The Angler. An old man with a short white beard, he seems eager to spend every 14th night alone at the sea shore, supposedly to catch fish. The thing is, the shore is incredibly rocky and one person claimed that the last time he went, he didn't bring a fishing rod. He's actually performing a ritual to appease a great old one, candles included.", "The Town Drunk. A man who seems to spend all his time at the tavern, and also seems constantly drunk. However, it seems like he's able to drink way more than any human (or dwarf) should. He's actually a hag under a polymorph spell, listening to everybody's conversations in an effort to learn who's the most vulnerable to being tricked or persuaded into doing bidding such as bringing potion ingredients.", "The Boss Kid. At the head of a quintet of local troublemaking town youths is a slightly older child. Since their family moved in last year they've been encouraging the local kids on bigger and 'better' pranks, from defacing garden fixtures and letting poultry lose in town to, more recently, outright stealing and property damage. Theyre bratty and abrasive, with absolutely no respect or regard for the opinions of most adults. Investigation reveals them as the wayward imp servant of a negligent wizard, who's preparing the children to be bold enough to prank the wizard in a way that will free the imp.", "The Helpful Lord - Inspired by Sir Pterry's Vetenari - The Lord of the city, who calls you in to have a friendly word. He or she isn't terribly warm and cuddly , but always has a point that they want to get across to the PCs and something they want done or not done. The point may be coded in a metaphor, but it is a very strong point nonetheless. Wise PCs will listen carefully and make sure they understand completely before leaving - The Lord does not ask twice.", "The Fixer - A helpful person who helps the PCs get jobs. However, the PCs have never actually seen him or her, as they always work through intermediaries. Maybe its a suggestion from the barkeep, or a note found in their bedroll, or an animal messenger of an unusual type. The jobs are inevitably profitable and well worth the party's time, but they always seem a bitoff. If the party starts trying to investigate who the Fixer is, the jobs dry up and the notes and whispers start taking on a warning tone instead. If they persist, their contacts first get nervous around them, then noticeably hostile.", "That Guy, You Know The One With The.Ummm - A contact of the party who is fairly often found in whatever their base of operations is, whether it's the castle, the inn, or the village market. He's friendly and helpful, but in a nondescript way. In fact, everything about him is pretty mundane and nondescript, and the mind just sorta slides off of him whenever you think about him too much. Wait, what was I talking about? Oh yeah! Anyways, I've got this great idea for a questI just can't remember who suggested it.", "The Book- a young bookstore owner who is seemingly engrossed in the latest pulp novel. On closer inspection the book he is reading is actually a reprint of an ancient tome of curses that if read aloud will wreck havoc.", "The Whispers: On the surface, just another gossiping fishwife. Always in everyone's business, always with the latest rumors. She's so much more than that. Weaving threads of dark magic through the community, binding those foolish enough to become indebted to her. She sees your deepest shame and files them all away. If your name appears in her ledger, your options are to either submit or die.", "The Cat Lady: A sweet woman who will invite you to her own house and treat you like family if you don’t have anywhere else you can stay, but who everyone in town mocks as a simple 'crazy cat lady'. She does, indeed, own a lot of cute cats or similar genre-appropriate creatures, and acts toward them as if they were her own children. However, she has one strange quirk, which she doesn’t talk about and gets nervous about when you ask her, and that’s how she’ll sometimes lock herself in the basement at night instead of going to bed. Every time she does, there are reports of attacks on livestock in the area that leave behind gruesome remains, and claw marks that are too big to be from one of her beloved kitties appear around the outside of the house, leading the party to wonder if her epithet is literal.", "The Scholar: A gloomy-looking young man with intense eyes from an aristocratic local family, often seen at the local library and only just glimpsed anywhere else. Only after a great deal of effort will he befriend any given player, but, once you’ve gotten close, he’ll be glad to help you in any of your research endeavours. However, you’ll find that he asks you morbid questions that often pertain to your past, that he actually looks up to whatever great terror haunts your campaign in a fatherly way, and that he remembers even the tiniest detail about what you’ve told him. He’s constantly writing things down in an array of notebooks and scouring over books on many subjects, but the ones he spends the most time looking over seem to be based around the necessary skills to become either a Rogue or an Illusion-specialist Wizard.", "The Red Cat: A Cat with unnaturally Red Fur and Green Eyes. This wild cat is constantly hungry, but otherwise friendly. The town that serves this cat is almost completely rat free, and no vermin dare to move in the streets. However, if somebody were to disenchant the cat, they will quickly discover that the cat was actually a Tarrasque stuck in a cat form through the wish spell.", "The Tree: A Simple Tree That seems to follow you around. Marks that you put on the tree remain, letting you realize that it’s been following you. Unsurprisingly, the tree is actually a Treant who have unspecified business with the party.", "The Golden Ant: Seemingly just a normal yellow ant, this humble creature brings collectables to the party, such as gold pieces. However, should you ever bite the hand that feeds you, the ant will, and mark my words, DESTROY YOU. Why? This ant is the avatar of Lathander, God of Birth and Renewal. In other words, it’s a CR 30 Ant that can use Smiting and divine-tier attacks. If that isn’t enough, being the impromptu Avatar of the God of Renewal, it just doesn’t die. You can stop it temporarily, but in the span of a long rest it’ll be back. And it’s omnipresent, meaning the moment you think you’re safe, Lathander will be tossing you 30ft into the air with their Ant Avatar.", "The Dream’s Voice: A Booming Voice that contacts the party, or a specific party member. They help the party with warnings and signs every once in a while, but remain hard to pin down. When the party begins to attack a Mindflayer colony, that’s when they realize that the Dream’s Voice is the Colony’s Elder Brain, who had taken up interest in the party’s endeavours. Being a Demigod-tier being, you can take a Warlock pact from the brain, for little cost. The catch being is, of course, if you die you’ll be turned into a Mindflayer.", "The Hunter: A Rather normal famous hunter from the local region, known for hunting beasts and saving people from the unforgiving wilderness. The twist is, he’s actually a werewolf, but remains completely oblivious to the facts laid before him, assuming he fights a beast that has been following him every night.", "The Seaweed Harvester: A woman who harvests and sells seaweed for use in food, herbalism, research, and paper-making. However, many figures have been found by the coast wrapped from head to toe in layers of seaweed. And there have been rumors of nearby villages being terrorized by humanoid-shaped monsters made of tangled bits of seaweed.", "The Beadle: An old man tasked with keeping order in the local temple. He is strict and unfriendly, but has never been seen doing anything against the law. He denies the rumors of ghosts haunting the synagogue, and swears he doesn't hear the screams coming from the blocked-off basement to the church.", "The Baronet: An old man who inherited the lowest possible hereditary title, he is not happy with his station. But he's nothing more than a grumpy old man, of course. The mysterious influx in attempts on nobles' lives are completely unrelated.", "An old man that listens: an ambitionless, unremarkable old man. He worked at the docks at a youunger age, just when the pirate syndicate was forming. Then he got a job as a kings guard during the war and throughout the coup that overthrew the king. Then he became a mason that helped build the city gates. Throughout all that he frequented taverns of all backgrounds and qualities. He doesnt want much in life but he knows a lot of secrets", "The Guy Who Knows a Guy: a modestly charismatic man who seems to always know just the right person to help you.

However, do not cross her or those she looks after or she will make the last meal you’ll ever have. But at least it will be delicious.", "The hippy: a quite, peaceable squatter with a sizeable garden who wants nothing more than to chill with his plants.

This NPC accuses everyone he talks to of minor crimes, like littering, or making too much noise.", "Am I hearing this right? This NPC mishears almost everything.

Possible explanation for why the NPC is wearing it: Their kid made it for them and now they are pretty much obligated to wear it.

    Retired adventurer stories
        You fellas make sure to bring ink and parchment, you hear! I remember back, oh, 35 summers ago we found a crypt too big to tackle at the time so we decided to make a map. Only old Bark toes, well we called him Bark toes on account of being a druid his real name was Faelwyn (Sounds elvish but he was a Dwarf, damnedest thing really)... but anyway, old Bark toes had buried all our paper! Said it was only proper respect for Father Tree. So we had to hunt down a rabbit, tan the hide, then burn the map into it. Took 3 days, and that map reeked up my pack something fierce!
        Hah! That reminds me of a particularly harsh winter when a dwarf I traveled with thought it’d be fun to explore a cave despite us being low on rations. Needless to say by the time spring rolled around I was plus a few Bullywug bites and minus a short bearded friend!
        I wouldn’t eat that if I was you. I was once treated to the spectacle of what I thought was a Tabaxi coughing up a hairball. Turns out a Remorhaze egg had been incubating in her gut from some dodgy stew and she quickly became its first meal.
        You think this is bad weather? I’ve seen it rain so hard that you’d swear it was coming from the ground and the sky at the same time. My boots filled so fast I had to walk barefoot to the nearest shelter I could find. Nearly stepped on a gas spore.
        Well, let me tell you: you can take the mightiest knight or wizard in the kingdom, and they'll duel a demigod or storm the gates o'hell. But you throw enough angry chickens at'em, sooner or later they'll go DOWN. Buy me a top-shelf whiskey and I'll tell you how it happened to the high priest. It might come in handy later on.
        That's a good story, but I bet you never saw a goliath hurl a gnome into the maw of an angry froghemoth, the hard part wasn't getting the gnome out of the creature, she did that much herself. The hard part was getting the stink o' frog guts off of the gnome.
        Things are different these days, they are indeed. I was a Red Arrow, didja know that? Travelled all over these lands, usually in small bands but sometimes they were hundreds of us. Thousands! Everywhere we went we'd work to make people proud of their own accomplishments. Make 'em happy, even if they said our arrows were orange! And if they stole from others, or said unkind things, why we stabbed them with our cold blue spears to let the people know how to behave like proper folk!
        This? Just a bit o' mead from home. Like wine, but made of honey; there's a bit of rose in this one, I think. Want a taste? (If offer is accepted, the mead is described as being pleasantly sweet and smooth, if a bit dry. May cause heartburn for those with hearts.) Good stuff, innit? My uncle's favorite; it's basically all he'd drink. We'd usually get that mead with the juniper berries mixed in, but my uncle preferred the rose mead. Said it tasted better. Dunno if I entirely agree, but that's what he would bring over. Heh...I remember one year, he came by, strangely empty-handed. My mum (his sister) asked where the mead was. That's the thing, he said, they said they was out. Some damn fool had made off with the barrels, leaving none for the rest of us. He suffered through the juniper mead, but he sure as hell wasn't happy about it. But then comes next week, right? He comes by with two kegs of the stuff. THEY FOUND IT, he said. He said he'd been walking along when he heard a commotion off the path, went to go check it out. And, sitting on top of a cart, drunk as hell, were the thieves. They hadn't even properly made off with the stuff, they were just sitting there barely off the road. Damn fools. My uncle seemed proud of himself. Man loved his mead. Maybe a little too much...
        Hah! That's nothing! You want to know what 'up shit creek without a paddle' really looks like? Lemme tell you a story: Me and four of me mates (or so I thought) were going through the mountains with a big load from... I won't tell, because I might actually get back to that pile o' gold one day. But! We were going through this wicked cave, and suddenly drow, the dark bastards, jump out of the shadows and start shouting at us in broken common. Now, we're alone in the mountains, one weeks travel from any civilization, and ambushed by a crew of drow. That's the shit creek, now where's me paddle gone? Well as if the situation wasn't bad enough, there's a cave in that separates me from me mates (got Spencer's leg too), and now I'm alone against a dozen pissed off drow. Now, how I got out of that situation with only a dirk and a shovel to my name, is a story that there isn't a cup of mead big enough to buy from me.
        So there I was, tied up. Not 20 feet from this sorceress and her gaggle of cultists. As the I was cutting my way through my bonds, and trying to signal to my mates that we need to stop this. The cultists were Chanting, the clouds were getting darker and the villager in the middle of the throng was getting really nervous. But all I could think about was that damn sorceress. Anyway, that's how I met my first ex-wife.
        That ain't nothin' to be scared of. You ever been chased by an undead thunder lizard, vomiting zombies? I tell yah, that'll change the color of your pants and maybe even your religion!
        So you should have seen it: Me, the most beautiful woman you ever saw and a table that turned out to be a mimic. Her palms were stuck to the surface for reasons I as gentleman shall not get into, and I was swinging my sword with one hand and hitching up my trousers with another. Anyway that was the last time I snuck into the Wizard's college storage cellar to fool around.
        No crud, there I was at the Battle of Deepwater Isle, standing in front of the walls to Waterdeep. A hundred Sahaugin were storming up the bank, angry as a cat in a pond. We held them back, dropping them 3 to 1. Problem is, that wasn't fast enough and they just kept coming. Well, the Blackstaffs showed up on the wall behind us. Yah ever see what a Fireball does to aquatic flesh? It scared 'em, scared 'em right good but I tell yah, you never smell something so bad as burning water goblin! Except maybe troglodyte...
        That's some nice shootin' there. Did I ever tell you about the time I one-shotted an orc with my sling? See, we was jumped on the Trade Way, just a simple escort job. This little warband of orcs jumped us on the road, lookin' for an easy take. Didn't expect we all had steel, yah see? We cut 'em down quick, but one slipped away, with a sack of valuables under his arm. That greenskin nicked an ox, no lie, tryin' to ride it for all its worth. He was bouncing all around and not gettin' too far. I picked up a rock off the ground, loaded my sling, one shot in the back of his head and he went tumblin'; dead before he hit the ground.
        That's a fine bit o' gold there. Reminds me of the time I was prospecting for gold up north of Neverwinter. Mount Hotenow was still having its rumblings and we were pickin' pieces that size out of the rivers!
        Oh don't complain about this little drizzle. Did I ever tell you about the time I was sailing back from Chult? Musta been only a couple years ago. We had 3 ships, full of old relics, when a bad squall kicked up. Swells were 30 to 40 feet and rain was crushing down on us in sheets. We barely stayed afloat, and what's worse; Everytime the lightning flashed, we saw tentacles rising up from the depths. Only 2 of our ships made it back... (Looks off distantly, glassy-eyed in memory)
        Now that's a fine bit o' cloth. Almost reminds me of Owlbear fur. I tell yah, ain't nothin' better for keepin' back the winter chill.
        I once wrestled 20 trolls with my bare hands! Yep, you should have seen those 15 hobgoblins, they were no match for me. Once they saw my muscles, those 10 kobolds ran for the hills!
        You'd be surprised how many times an adventurer met their end from overconfidence. I saw a man that cut a giant in two with a single slice die after insisting the river only looked deep.
        Never ask a paladin about how their oath works unless you want an hour long moral philosophy lecture complete with some shameless proselytizing.
        Took us nine days to find that phylactery. The lich was pretty pissed when we showed him it. That was the fourth time we killed that ancient relic disguised as a man but that was the first time any of us saw fear in an undead's eyes.
        Get bent, young-blood. You don't know nuthin' bout no adven'turing. I know so, 'cause if you'd tell me a story 'bout what yuve seen and I passed my wine jug wi'out noticin' then I'd cut my luv'ely beard! And I. Dunt. Cut. Muh. Beard. Or share teh wine...' (Now the PC's have a chance to RP their characters telling a story of the experiences their character has had.)
        Say now, this reminds me of the time old Zollio rode a giant monitor lizard round the upside of a bridge to get a clear shot at the turtle dragon harassing us. Yessir, he was a sight to behold. Fell the whole way down and still managed to get the killing blow off that bow of his. I can't remember how we made it out of that one.
        So... you heard of the pale elf Drost Durden and his white tiger? He defied the laws of the over-light mountains, descended from their snowy peaks, and became a hero of the people. But thats just what the stories say, he is probably as cruel as the rest of them. (Note, there is a Dark Elf there listening to this story who looks very... very... very tired at listening to this)
        See this scar on my chin? The first deer I ever killed, I must have been 14, no 13. I waited for hours in a tree. Shivering in the cold, hungry as a dog. I pissed myself. Finally a young buck casually strolled up to my tree. I was so cold, I was scared my staccato breathing would scare him off. I raised my bow and my hands were shaking. Luckily it was directly under me. I couldn't miss. I let go and the arrow stuck him good in his side. It jumped up and buck a few times like a roaring bull. Then it hopped around in a a zig zag and almost seemed to lay down for a nap. I was young but I knew to wait a moment before approaching. I slowly climbed down the tree. I slipped the last couple feet. I sauntered over to the deer. I slowly kneeled down beside him. I took a moment to admire the steam coming off his body which some druids believe is the deer's life essence leaving this plane. I leaned in close to his face and I thanked him for his meat which I was about to consume. The deer pulled its head back and butted me right in the face. His antler leaving a deep gouge in my chin. He jumped up took a couple steps and again collapsed under its own weight. At 13 years old, I provided for my family that cold night.
        When I was your age, we had no idea that there were any other 'planes'. You were born on the prime material, and that's the way we liked it!
        When I was your age, we walked thousands of leagues to dungeons! Uphill both ways!
        Let me tell you something, young adventurer. Treat well you're boots for they protect you more than you know. That being said, I will never wear another pair again. I traded my boots for route sandals long ago, and let me tell you, I ain't putting on another pair of boots! I'd rather die! What do you mean I've used the same phrase twice in one sentence?
        If you suspect that you're gonna run into gnolls, just piss yourself! Hyenae respect the scent of piss. Makes 'em feel like they're messing with the property of someone powerful, ya know?
        I've never been a fan of 'preparing' spells. Back with the clergy of my youth, if you wanted a disease to be cured, THAT'S TOO BAD! YOU HAD TO DIE, JUST AS AMAUNATOR INTENDED!
        I never much cared for dwarfs. To stalky. Too hairy. What are gonna do with all that hair, hm? I don't trust it.
        Listen well. You need a danger word. I don't care about safe words or what you do with them. A danger word. Some things out there change their shapes. Mimic us. Hide the truth from your eyes. We had a rule. You found a way to work the danger word into conversation if your suspicions were up, but not your patience. 'Eaglepeak'. That was ours. 'Weather here is nothing like Eaglepeak.' or, 'The food here is worse than Eaglepeak.'
        One day I wondered off from my caravan to relieve myself in private. Just my luck I was ambushed by bandits at the worst possible moment. Then for the first time in my life I was happy to hear the raspy scream of an owlbear. The bandits all ran in opposite directions, the owlbear had pecked on of them really good and was in the process of turning him into a pincushion with its pointy beak. I pulled my pants up, again at the worst possible moment, and I slowly turned around and walked away, once I got far enough to not hear the pecking of flesh I ran.
        There we were, trapped on the bridge between the Harpies and the 4-armed Pirate-Gorillas, when Smendrik the Adequate (as we called him then) got the bright idea to cast Featherfall and Burning Hands through a barrel while we all stood on top! How we got the barrel is another interesting tale, you see it four years prior to then that we came across...
        One time we met a Dwarf who bragged that he could disarm ANY trap. So we find something that looks suspicious and we let him prove himself. He's sitting there for 10 minutes trying to disarm a weird little square of tile and a gout of flame shoots out of the wall next to him and sets his beard on fire! He runs around smacking himself trying to put himself out until our cleric finally extinguished him with a water spell. He stands there for a bit, beard half burnt off and drenched in water, looks at us and says 'just avoid that tile'.
        One time, a long while ago, Trudy and I were trying to nab some merchant’s permit from a fancy party and Trudy got made. So, to sneak her out, I hid her underneath my ball gown. We were both lucky my corset was big enough. Of course, leaving so suddenly would have been suspicious, which is how I spent 3 hours walking around a party with my sister under my dress. Thankfully, no one offered me a dance.
        Never step through a portal. Not once, not ever. My party went through a portal that was supposed to be a shortcut into a wizard's tower, right to the top. Promise of some quality wands in that tower, made us step through without thinking too hard on it. Five years later I came back to the Prime Material with no friends and no wands. I don't talk about those years. Just don't trust portals is all I'm saying.
        I won't stand for slander against Warforged. They got souls and I won't hear no arguments about it. No talk of 'tinmen' or 'automatons' at my campfire. You take that backwards thinking to your little farm and hang up your sword, because you ain't fit to be an adventurer. You fight with a 'forged at your back, or you listen to them talkin' about the friends they lost in the first war, and you would know. They might be more human than you or me. Certainly more human than an elf. Don't get me started on those knife-ears.
        Never wake a sleeping Gnome. I'm not kidding about this. Sure, you know not to wake a Barbarian, liable to get your arms chopped off, but Gnomes are worse. They can cast spells before they're fully awake, see? Still half dreaming. You haven't regretted a decision quite like getting polymorphed first thing in the morning.
        That flintlock you have there, may I see it? Ah, this reminds me of the rifle used by the infamous Tabaxi mage-slayer Odd Song Sung. I tracked that master assassin across this land, to-and-fro. Through battlefields and ruined cities older than you can fathom, yet she always stayed one step ahead. The last time I saw her, atop a tower above the street of Mordhau, eschewing her sights to read the charms she hung from the barrel of her weapon with fine chains as the winds of death shifted through them. I charged up those stone stairs faster than I have ever moved in all my days. But when I burst onto that damn platform there was nothing save for a single scrap of parchment held under a lose stone. 'Goodbye my friend' it said in a curling script, 'it has been an honour fleeing you'. I never saw that Tabaxi again.
        When you're in those swamps, never, I repeat, never follow the lights, I've seen what happens, some might drown in the muck, others might get ambushed by lizardfolk, those are the lucky ones, the unlucky ones, they get torn to shreds the fog itself ripping them to shreds like a butcher, so fast they don't have time to scream...I've seen things, are you sure you still want to go out there?
        ... and so there 'e was when Oi' saw 'em, bold as a blacksmith strikin' hot-steel, 'e struck that demon on the fore'ead wif 'is fryin' pan! Oi'll ne'er outlive the day! Oi' outlived 'em tho' tha's fer sure, poor bloke 'uz ripped in 'alf shortly thereafter, e' wuz! But Ser Percivale 'e bought tha' rest'a us poor blighters enough time for Brofver Caedsmuire to Banish em, and tha's th' reason Oi' carry this f'oine fryin' pan on me belt, see? 'Sides from bein' 'imm-a-nent-ally prack-ti-cal', it's one-a-them 'Me-minty.. Me-minnow.. Me-mento Mor-as' and prack-ti-klee an ''oly relic'!
        I used to be a blacksmith, but I got run out of town after a string of unlucky lasses had bairns which looked a mite too much like me. I ever tell you the time I had to shoe the Lord of the Nine Hells' Mare? A Nightmare they calls 'em, and she tweren't no mare, I tells yah... well, anyway she were a mite skittish, and so I took hold of her bridle and trotted her a bit, and I tell you each stride of hers was seven leagues, and dragged me along for the ride, and each time she would stop at the house of a lonely local lass and t'wouldn't budge a step afore I had made a call, then after that mare she'd take another step (with me for the ride) to the next maid's cottage, and on and on you see...
        My party would agree but I was the worst bard they ever had. Let me tell you a story to illustrate how bad I was. So here we were taking the time to refresh ourselves in the city when we find out that the town is using some weird magic to keep the place going, some type of sinister version of Druid magic. So there we were investigating when my party member ups and attacks one of the guards because they were in our way despite all of us agreeing to be discreet. So in a panic and also because I felt bad for the guy I casted healing word in hopes of maybe getting the guards off our back by being nice. Well I took out my flute and blew the flattest note my ears have ever heard and I saw that man cough up blood because regardless. If that situation wasn’t so crazy I would’ve laughed my head off that I actually hurt someone with healing word but hey you live and learn and I needed a lot to learn.
        Wanna know how I got these scars? Biggest dragon you've ever seen...probably the ugliest too. Anyways me and my mates were hacking him up when he took a wild swipe at me because I insulted his gecko mother. So there we were, me in his claws at least 500 feet in the air. I wrench myself free, climb up to his back and give him a good one two, ride his lifeless corpse all the way back to the hoard. We crash and I am launched noggin first into this beautiful baby I've on my back right now. This greataxe cut me up nice that day, but all the best lovers do that's what I always say!
        You want to know where I got this sword huh? What if I told you I had to go the ninth hell and debate Asmodeus? Or the depths of pandemonium where I lost at least two friends and forgot one other? Mayhaps I got it from the githyanki pirates that killed my dog so I killed them all in return? Or maybe it was fashioned from the brain stem of the beholder that insulted my previous sword size? Perhaps I got it from the ancient vault of Dren'Dar the conquerer after we defeated his ancient blue dragon lover? Or perhaps I got it from Freaky Falzahad's Magic Emporium down the street? You'll have to buy me two or three more ales to find out, friend.
        Trust me pal, the best part of adventuring is the food. You ever had dragon stew spiced with the ancient herbs found in a tomb and the marrow of a direboar? Ugh... Speaking of direboar...the tenderloin with a little high altitude mashed potatoes gardened by an centaur? You havent lived friend. Or granita (fruit ice) made by various fruits you had frozen during a fight with a white dragon? Refreshment for days. I could go on for years my friend, but I have another dish calling my name, until next time!
        I lost this hand fighting sirens a mile off the coast, oh... ten years back, I reckon. I keeps a leather pouch of the bones to remind me of my mortality; each drilled and filled with a mix of tin, lead, and a shaving from a single sterling piece, blessed by a priest of Saint Quimbles; and etched with the runes. Shalls I cast them and divine thy fate?
        Best not to deal with nobility who ask for discretion in carrying out their tasks. Better yet, best not to accept a blabbermouth into your ranks. Best not travel to the shadiest part of town and loudly announce your search of information on an assassination plot. Best not to blindly follow the kind old gentleman out of town, as he knows the assassins' hideout. Best not to let your guard down and invite an ambush on your friends. Best not leave them to their deaths in desperation towards saving your own skin. Best not let your past force you into a life of running and hiding. Best not to deal with nobility who ask for discretion.
        There we were, about to be over-run by the damned, our backs against the fallen portcullis, when out of 'er satchel Sister Bloeddwyd Angelique pulled forth the candle prepared by the Holy-Matron and blessed by the Light. When she lit her taper, the candle shone forth a light fit to blind us! She placed the candle in the lock of the portcullis and a great flash and shout of a hundred wrathful angels blew us an opening! I'd not be sitting here telling you the tale were it not for her!
        Never underestimate a Kobold, ye hear? Me brothers in arms wound up as food in thier cook fires, and I'd be there too if'n I didn't high-tail it the moment I saw those first traps! Oh, aye, you call me a coward, but I'll ne'er go down any hole where'st I's s'pect them scaly buggers to be lurkin'! You's best be doin' the same as I, and mind yourself! Mark me words!
        Aye, nowhere, no place in this world leaves you weary as the blasting fields. Scores of brave men and women have been swallowed by the harrowed place. For what? Glory. Ha. Riches. What vanity we had. The earth rumbles with every step you take. The smell burns your eyes and the air takes your senses. Me and my mates, brave as we once were, never feared it though. We should’ve. We should’ve feared the jets of fire that shot out like columns holding the sky above. But we didn’t. No. We marched, knowing the dangers. Knowing the risks. Knowing the rewards. Damn our arrogance. If we weren’t foolhardy enough to turn at the sight of that place, we certainly hadn’t the mind to beware the creatures that called the place home. That’s where I found out how true horror felt. How it seeps into your bones.
        I was a hired by a small band of naïve adventurers to guide them through the mountain passes in early winter. We should have turned back when the skies began to darken. But the gold... The storm hit hard and a thick, heavy blanket of snow covered every discernable landmark. The storm continued without end. I soon lost my way but, I kept that to myself. Because, the gold... Wolves took two of them in the dead of night, one froze to death after falling through the ice, and the last one? After six days in that frozen hell, I was the only one to walk out. But the gold...
        (While tuning a lute) Have I played 'The Mouse and the Magister' for you yet? That used to be my specialty. Never failed to get the people clapping and the gold flowing. Now how did it go? 'La de da... mouse...' That's not it. When I played this for the Queen of Names she made me a knight on the spot. That's a true story. You can call me Sir, please and thank you. 'La de da de da... mouse...' Damn... Let me just play 'Sunrise Over Waterdeep' for you again.
        I'm telling you, first time I fought one it was called a Water Normal. That was many moons back now, you can believe that. Water Normals, used to pop out of wells in villages, just about every harvest, sure as the crops. Then a few decades go by and they're not so regular, we start to hear them called Water Uncommons. Over hunted, see? Nowadays you almost never see them. You worry much when you get water from a well? You're welcome. And so, yes, Water Weird, because they are now.
        Just sos you know, you can dance with the dead in the pale moonlight. It ain't the dancin' that's the problem, it's the leavin' after. Their grip is a might bit stronger than a clamp o' iron. It probably wasn't worth the gold my pals bet me to do it. (He/she shows off a huge scar). You should've seen the other guy, though.
        We once convinced a kobold colony to mine out a block of stone in the ceiling of a dragon's lair, dropping in on their head. Dragon problem done just like that, though, those damn kobolds did drive us out before we managed to take a share of the dragon's hoard...
        I only loved one man: Bernar was his name, and what a fine man he was. He could swing an axe like a twig, and drank brandy like it was water. I had to leave him, however... I took a contract to hunt down a hag. Turns out my suspicions were right.. it was my mother in law!
        Now, I COULD spend the next turn of the hourglass telling you lies about the best way to wield a longsword; lies I learned guarding the Duke, and learned were lies when the Masked Menace cut the Duke's Demon-possessed head clean off; but since you're buying me a drink, tell me a bit of your travels?
        Throws his drink at the painting of a wealthy nobleman. Noble my rear end! I've seen that man make love to a sheep after just 2 cups of mead. That ironbrained oaf still owes me 30 gold pieces too. I won it fair and square in a card game. He said he was good for it and I let him off the hook at the time but I should've taken his thumb as collateral and I woulda been justified to do it too. The healer I ran with at the time could've put it back on 3 weeks later in just 10 minutes I tell ya.
        That sure is a nice weapon you have there, young adventurer. But it's not about the size or value of the weapon, but the way that you use it. The older adventurer reaches for something strapped to their back and brings it into the younger adventurer's vision This here is 'Pointy.' My party and I were asleep in the forest one night, when I woke up surrounded by goblins and the sounds of screaming and crunching. No weapons, no armor, and my fellow adventurers were already as good as dead. The only thing nearby was this one strong, arm-span long, and unusually pointy stick. It must have been sent by divine beings that cast pity on me because it seemed to shine as I quickly reached for it. I picked it up, and I just started jabbing it at every goblin that came near me. Quick thrusts. I aimed for the eyes. I was there all night, and, just as I was about to collapse from exhaustion, the sun started to rise, and the goblins, many of whom were missing at least one eye each at this point, retreated. Ever since then, I have always kept Pointy with me to remind me that the most humble of tools can have the greatest of effects, to remind me of my lost comrades, and, well, in case of goblins.
        Speaking of alcohol, if you ever go to the Pinepoint Inn down the street NEVER drink more than one pint of their Hunter's Meade. I know it may be delicious, but I did it a couple of years ago and I woke up in a cave surrounded by a group of Kobolds who apparently started worshiping me as their new regent. Took me three weeks to get out of there! I can hold my liquor, but I'm never drinking Hunter's Meade again.
        The Icy Wastes are cold, cold, cold I tells ya! Only madmen and the darkest of evil travels there! I lost a hand and a leg to the cold, after I followed the Lost Prince and the Crusade to find the Egg! We found the Egg alright; it was beautiful, like a singular jewel, just sitting there on the altar of the Icy Temple, glittering for all to see! Then the men began to scream and freeze into place! I ran away, dragging my frozen limbs, of fifty men that went in, only three returned, and the Prince was not one of them!
        A cloaked and masked lady once hired us to take her deep into the woods, then bade us keep our distance while she spent the night alone atop a hill crowned with a ring of faerie stones. She never told us her name and commanded us never to speak of it. But do you remember the festivities when old Queen Gennereth turned out not to be barren after all? And isn't her daughter a rare beauty, like something you've never seen? Makes you think.
        Before you use your spell casting powers to win the affections of a fair woman or gallant gentleman remember the tale of the wizard Geniinewab. When Geniiwewab heard that the fair maiden Alessandra's beloved crow was ill he trapped all the town clerics in a forcecage so that Alessandra would be forced to consult him instead. In an effort to demonstrate his magnificent power Geniinewab killed Alessandra's crow with finger of death and then used a wish spell to revive it. The night after casting that wish spell Geniinewab caught the flu. Since the great wizard was enfeebled by the wish spell and all the town healers were locked up Geniinewab died within a week.
        Now, don't believe a word they say 'bout the moon being made of green cheese. I should know, I was there, me and my mates, you see, we sailed there one night when we were lost in a thick fog off the coast of Nuperie... Just remember when sailing, if you see a big fog bank roll in under a moonlit sky.. you should turn the ship right around and 'Nuperie' right out of there! Ha Ha Ha!
        My faithful hounds!', they's call us, their Majesties would! Why.. hold on, my neck itches.. would you scratch it? These old arms can't quite reach behind.. ahh! Oh yiss, thats divine.. that thumping noise? Oh.. sorry.. my leg does that when I get scratched there.. well anyway, they used their baleful magics to turn us into the very hounds they imagined us as, the party and I, you see.. we spent a good six years in that state, hunting the nine-tailed fox spirits! How'd we change back? Well their Majesties got offed by a party of adventurers, and wouldn't you know it, we changed right back to ourselves... Petersen though still had that awful case of magical fleas!
        Now now.. where's my pen and paper? I must certainly write down an account of your travels, they seem comparable or even to eclipse my own, most remarkable tales... most remarkable! Why, I too, recall coming up against savages, and thought my solution to be quite ingenious, you see, my party and I would replace the gemstone eyes of their idolatrous god with costume jewelry INDISTINGUISHABLE to the real thing... unfortunately, someone had already beaten us to the punch! The gems were fake the whole time! Oh, you should have seen Lord Perfidy's apoplectic face! He kept that face for the few moments of his life he had remaining after taking that savage's spear to the guts! Which, I daresay, still haunts me whenever I close my eyes for more than a moment...
        ...that little spark and glimmer in a person's eyes when you JAB your blade into their GUTS and they are seconds away from slipping out of this reality? Oh, my favorite look indeed! Yours?
        Me? I knew th' 'Dread Pirate Roberts' back when 'e was just known as 'The Mildly Frightening Pirate Roberts'! T'was I what gave 'e and his 'ole crew th' idear to re-brand, I did! S'truth!
        ... And THAT is the story of how I lost my leg! You ready to hear the story of how I lost my... oh what? Out of time? I'm sorry Children, that story will have to happen at another time! Good bye! Be good now, Children! So long! Byeee! Now, mates, where was I? Oh yes, the story of how I lost my right eye! It's a sordid tale involving the most beautiful ghost lady-captain I ever did see! Our love was one for the ages! I had my eye removed and magically enchanted to only ever see her, I did! And that was how I came to lose my Left Hand! You see it was shortly after...
        ... and THAT, my friends, is why you don't go sticking ANY part of your AN-AT-OH-MEE anywhere near a mimic what looks like a KEE-YOOT little innocent stuff-ed an-ee-myool, no siree! Why that poor himbo over there lost more than one peice of his elf to that mistake! What? He looks fine to you? Why that boy is devastated! Devastated!
        Now, I'm usually pretty good with the ladies, no lie, but I tell you when I, in a drunken stupor, asked the Goddess Ishtar for a kiss, and got one! Why, I was over the moon! That night we made sweet, passionate love... you should have seen it! raunchy humping motions... but.. I feel I can trust you with this, the next morning, there was a donkey in my bed!! I never did see where Ishtar went, and now mere mortals just aren't the same. Ever since then I've decided to limit myself to just ten, ten drinks.. maybe twenty a night, so's the next time I see that Goddess, I won't pass out and get to see her afore she leaves...
        And on tha twelfth night, it 'as exactly as dark as on the 'leventh, but then BAM! suddenly tha' brightest light I never did seen came shinin' outta that tower and ALL the demons of Hell a'came a'riding out of it, it near sounded like.. the light made that much noise, jennle-men, I guarantee.
        When we moved to break into the block wall bricking up the secret passage, we found the body of someone who died trying to escape. Their fingers were worn to stumps and the back of the blocks were bloody. Never did find out what scared 'em so.
        All I'm sayin' is a good adventurer needs a good pair of gloves. Too many potion sellers don't wash their hands, and who knows what kind of poison is gonna get under your nails? And besides, if you hold your weapon without a pair, your palms will get all calloused. Mine are smooth as a baby's bottom, wanna feel?
        If you're ever in the deep forest, and come across a clearing you've not seen afore, empty save for a ring of mushrooms, turn around, and walk away. It ain't worth your troubles, believe me. You know how hard it is to escape the Fae? Damned bastards took me for everything I had, and I'm lucky at that. And this damned mark on my hand never did fade, either.
        I remember once back in my mercenary days, we were besieging this walled city... on a hill... on a peninsula. Perfect defensive position, right? Our employer was smart enough to know that a normal assault would have been suicide. So we just blasted the place with explosive spells. Days and days of hurling fire and lightning at those walls while trying not to get shot by their archers... I can still hear the booming in my ears sometimes. Eventually we brought a wall down and stormed the city. Damned messy business.
        It was the third month of the Long Cloud, by our reckoning. I was out hunting when I saw some shady looking folk around what looked like an altar. I laid there for a little, listening to them chant gibberish, but I knew I couldn't take 'em all in a fight. Left a few traps for the bastards, though. Never found out if they were behind the whole thing.
        Lemme tell you something kid, wizards are all fine and dandy... as long as they stick to the normal spells. But you ever meet a wizard who goes on about experimenting, and new forms of magic... you get out of there. Nine times out of ten that whole thing will end in a big explosion.
        These ales are practically water! A true man's drink can only be found in the Crested City. They use their crystals, ya see, and grind 'em up and put 'em in the drinks. Stronger and better than any other! I need to get back there some day.
        Aliases are healthy, kid! You give a false name when dealing with anyone that might want you harmed. Not to mention fairies and the like. I've got a dozen or so names you might find around the country! Of course this isn't my real one either. You really think my parents named me Mortimer?
        I don’t take drinks or food from people I don’t know. Got me in trouble quite a few times in my youth. I thought myself as quite charming, and tried making conversation with a Hag my party and me were having dealings with. Asked about the pot of soup she had cooking behind her, and instead of an answer I got a bowl full of the stuff. Well, I couldn’t just back down from a challenge, could I? It tasted alright, and the she told me about the slaad eggs she had planted in it. Told me I had three months before it would erupt and kill me, unless we went and got the scales of a black dragon for her. Lucky for me, I could think on my feet, and so I stuck my fingers down my throat and puked the monstrosity out onto her! Oh, she was raging mad, and my party was about ready to kill me after we fought her. But it all worked out alright, didn’t it?
        When the King did call for brave 'venturers explorin' the frontiers, I did answer the call. When the King did demand we'n all lay down our lives and clear these lands in 'is name, I did, and my wife and children too! And, when it were them what lost that life an' I forced to remain these 15 years past, what does the King and Crown do when dark-forces do gather and threaten all we have done? Does e' go reward our service? Does the Crown protect? Nay! The Crown abandons us! Mayhaps we should abandon the Crown...
        Fire, I says; 'tis your best friend an' t'worst enemy t'at the same time! Sees this scar 'pon me face? Flask of oil 'xlpoded afore I could throw 'er when the party and I faced off against that dark wizard Woss'zname? Frank!? Frank me boy, what was that wizard's name? The one where I got this scar strangling the life out of with these two hands!? Oh, Frank's asleep I see. Too boring for you, eh Frank!??!
        When Ser Porthe fell in battle off the far shores of Guthay, we saw fit to preserve the body from putrefaction by storing it in a cask of fine Canary that had previously been Ser's favorite. Seeing as not to waste any, as they likely took up quite a bit of the barrel, we shared a goodly portion with the fellow crew, before sealing. Now, I dare say, I scarcely can take a glass without remembering and mourning the fact that we still lack the golds required for their resurrection... Let's Toast to Good Ser Porthe! Ser Porthe!
        I came here to drink and forget the heaps of trouble my spouse lays upon me on a daily basis. Oh fer certain, I marched with the Lord against that vile Hag and their coven, but no matter how far we marched we could never catch em. Each night we lost a soldier or more, when they ran from the camp screaming of night terrors, we usually found their bodies in the morning... tell you the truth, Id rather be there than back home with the fractious family, some days...
        Loudest t'ing I never did 'ear, I confess, wuz tha 'splosion of tha Powder Stores on tha' Good Ship Lawbringer. Oh she brought tha law that day, I was on 'er, and she brought tha Law of Unintended Consequences! Shattered tha port, and collapsed tha channel, she did, and collapsed tha sea wall too! Lost us tha battle, and tha city when they gained entrance via tha hole. I managed ta survive, but I lost my hearing and was imprisoned and then enslaved for six years! Was a miracle and a steep one I paid for, when a travelling cleric healed me, and took me from that place...
        You 'kiss the toe' yet? S'posed to be a ritual, you know. A warnin' against those who dont pay their tab. I got a deal I did! Thats my toe, I paid my tab with it! You wouldnt mind buyin me a drink now, would ya?
        I tells ya, I saw FOUR, FOUR! masked Tortles down in those sewers! Meanest I ever came across. Scuffled with 'em once on a run for the society, see.. they kept shouting if I wanted a piece-a-them, well.. when I saws they were all armed, and with that tough shell.. well, I turned tail and ran. Now, don't go thinking me a coward now, when I found out they took down that Grell, that golem, and those masked warrior monks that worshipped it? Well.. seems I made the smart choice, friend-o; the smart choice!
        Y'all ever heard of the snail that wouldn't die? Once we were delving in a deep forgotten dungeon, looking fo' loot and other bits. Well we found some, a great big chest that was lock'd like sumfin tough. Well our sneakthief open'd it and there weren't nothing but single snail, still living but it didnt have no food in there. Little thing started to crawl out towards the north, ignoring everythin' we did to it. Scared me silly, still never did get us no loot from that place.
        ... so trapped as we were and with days before help would arrive, we did what we had to to survive. I'm not proud of want we did, but I challenge any decent creature in the same position to do different. Anyways, I'll tell you something for nothing. Kobold doesn't taste anything like chicken.
        Once knew human. Skinny little thing she was. Ranger. Good with a bow. Obsessed with herself. Beauty treatments, strange potions. You name it, she'd try it. Got herself hold of some paste with flail snail muck in it. Rubbed it all over her skin. The next morning, she started glowing all different colours. Real bright like. Never laughed so hard in my life. Like watchin a magic show. Took us weeks and weeks to find a wizard to reverse the effects. Sometimes, when she hiccuped, she'd still let out a little burst of colour.
        All nobles are bastards, right? Only some are bigger bastards than others. Myself and a group of, um, compatriots got ourselves hired by a bunch of farmers to defend a town and a handful of villages from some hobgoblin raiders. Couple days in, we mange to capture one alive. Turns out the local baron was the one that hired them. He wanted to raise taxes and was using the raids as an excuse. Anyway, long story short, the baron ended up on the wrong end of a hobgoblin sword and the lads ended up being very well paid.
        Take my advice son, steer clear of fey. Don't mess with the little ones and steer clear of the big ones. Don't talk to them, don't even look at them if you can avoid it. Carry some cold iron on you, just in case. And especially, don't bargain with them. No good can come of it. There's a reason they call me 'Tails' and it ain't because I'm a good story teller.
        My arm? Did I lose my arm in the war? Well, let me put it this way young person. The next time a wizard tells you to keep your arms at your sides during a teleport spell, you do it!
        (Hoarse voice) Harum... I haven't cough... haven't seen much of folk in the past year, bit out of practice talking. But been out on my own since I uh... lost my adventuring partners to a wolf attack. (scratches their neck, a bite scar is visible on it) Biggest wolf I ever seen, tore through four of us like we was thin cloth stretched over bales of hay. Bowled me over onto a rock, hit my head and was out for I don't know how long. (clears throat and it sounds like a low growl) Came to and that beast was gnawing on what was left of my buddies, muzzle soaked in blood. I must've made a noise because it suddenly looked at me, eyes ablaze... (glances nervously at the moon breaking through the clouds) That was the unluckiest and luckiest time of my life. It jumped me, slowed down I guess from being gorged on my friends. Got its jaws locked on my throat but I got a hand up in time, saved me from getting killed instantly. (holds out a hand with deep, ragged scars all along it, highlighted in the glow of the campfire) Figured I was done for but my other hand happened to fall on what remained of our priestly fella. Whatever god he worshiped must've put his dagger right where I'd grab it. I just stabbed blindly. Maybe hit something important 'cause the creature leapt away like it was seared with a hot poker. (pulls out a fancy dagger, more ceremonial than practical, its silvery blade shining. The speaker's voice grows more hoarse, a barking cough escaping their lips) Kept it with me ever since... just... in... caaaaasse.... (And the moon breaks from the clouds entirely, bathing the campfire circle in its pale glow as the speaker bends double with a howl of pain as their limbs start to contort...)
        I got lost in a good book, once. Took me pages and pages to find my way out, and you ask me where my fingers on my left hand went? Paper cuts, I tell yah! Damn thing up and swallowed me whole while reading! Was my favorite book too...
        Strange lad? You want to hear something strange? Well, I adventured with this mage for a couple of years. He was a bit ... odd. Kept to himself mostly, very private and shy. Insisted on separate sleeping quarters. Mumbled a lot. We all figured, y'know, magic user. Weirdness. Paranoia. Odd behaviour. Strange smells. It comes with the territory. Too much mercury and bat shit in spell components. Anyway, we get hired by this prince to get rid of a gauth and when we tracked it down, the thing just laughed and laughed at us. Then 'gulp', it ate our mage, all in one go. Then, it spat out three Batiri goblins. One. Two. Three. Whole and intact. Damnedest thing I ever saw. When the gauth stopped laughing, he thanked us for the meal and entertainment and said he'd be moving on. Turns out, the little buggers had found some kind of enchanted cloak and had been sitting on each others shoulders. Had us proper fooled.
        Fundamental rule of adventuring my friend: always, always, always make sure your potions haven't expired. Knew this elf that left a potion of animal friendship in his backpack for a wee bit too long. We were trying to get past some wolves at the mouth of a cave, and he remembered this potion. Well, the wolves became friendly. A little too friendly if you get my drift. That poor elf, he had creatures coming at him from all directions. Spent the next few hours running around trying to avoid the attention of bears and bats and birds. Let that be a lesson to you all: test before you taste.
    Tavern Keeps
        Davis Owensby - A retired farmer who converted his old barn into a tavern. This tavern keeper brews all his own beers with hops that he grows. He will sit and talk about farming for hours, if you let him. He is worried about his cows going missing, and suspects the ogres in the hills are to blame.
        The Ghost of Sel'seren - This tavern is haunted by the previous tavern keeper who died a few years ago. Sel'seren was a gorgeous elven woman who treated all her guests like family. People who stay the night in this inn report having their covers being pulled over them on cold nights on their own, and mugs of ale being refilled on their own.
        Mugsy - The ex-criminal Mugsy is a goblin who pulled off a BIG heist in his past, and is using the tavern as a cover to stay under the radar. He speaks fluent Thieve's Cant and usually takes a liking to rogue players. He charges paladins extra.
        Slunk Copperpot - Slunk is a goblin stripper who recently came into possession of her own tavern because the previous owner died of mysterious circumstances. Slunk was always his favorite dancer, and he left the tavern to her in her will. The strange thing is, he died within days of telling Slunk that information. What a coincidence!
        Al'Ashir - This foreigner from the desert is looking to start his new business in a land far from his home. He is overly accommodating, and typically cooks all the meals himself. If the patrons aren't used to desert cuisine, they may find it particularly on the dry side.
        Thain D’ulbris - A former adventurer who says he has traveled with all the great heroes though none of his stories match up he is a portly fun loving man. Though he is a bit loud he has ties to the rebels though he doesn’t advertise this other than his rampant and aggressive nationalism he uses as a cover.
        Lily - This charming, attractive Elven woman always seems to know exactly what to say to cheer up patrons and get them talking. A town drunk swears that she's actually a disguised monster and the head of a local organized crime syndicate.
        Mimi - This enchanted wizard's familiar/apprentice runs the bar, using her telekinetic abilities in place of hands. The bar features a variety of exotic drinks from across the world and even some extraplanar ones (dangerous and highly expensive drinks only available with a reservation and advance order).
        Nimue - This bright red horned tiefling has spent quite a bit of money on the decor of her bar, which is themed after hell. The bar/restaurant is upscale, and the food and drinks, while good, are pricy. This is a popular spot for the children of nobility to attend. The bartender has acquired several rocks enchanted with Nystul's Magic Aura, which she has put in the foundations in order to create an 'aura of evil' around the place.
        Kra'ax Three Claw - The hulking Half-Dragon is surprisingly well mannered, but will violently throw out anyone they learn takes part in the trapping of animals. They lost their left foot to an owlbear trap while traveling the wilds and sorely miss going on long treks through the untamed wilderness. Will buy or trade at a very fair price for fresh wild berries and unique stones.
        Grin Stoneboot - A stout dwarf, with fiery red hair and no beard, that owns and operates a tavern carved entirely from one large stone block. He’s known for his wild tales of his missing flying monkey. Every time one of his patrons asks him something he always manages to lead the conversation toward his missing monkey (Nam). Rumor has it that Grin shaved his beard and won’t regrow it until he finds his lost friend. I’m sure Grin would have a fantastic reward for the player that found poor Nam.
        Orx Thrallkeep - former gladiator, living his best life running a bar with a solid connection to the local sporting events community and betting parlors. His favorite weapon, a silver trident, is more than just decoration behind the bar.
        Abeg Two-Smiles - reformed thief, he was horribly scarred by an angry tavern owner during his early life and eventually returned from his adventuring days to not only buy the bar itself but also to help guide young, troubled future thieves by honing their skills and boasts that anyone able to successfully steal a mug from his bar will drink free for a year. So far, none have been able to do so.
        Juli Wise (formerly Jani the Jannkiller) - druid with a focus on elemental magic, she's laying low for the time being until the next planar alignment allows her return to some mysterious place where her allies are waiting. In the meantime, she's keeping busy and trying get information from every traveler staying at her roadside inn.
        Herk - a goblin who found the perfect score in treasure hunting - dead adventuring groups. His specialty is building quiet, lethal traps and placing them in front of already-cleared dungeons after the adventurers have entered. They die, he collects the loot and puts it to work building a safe space for his extended family. Remarkably, he's happier running a tavern than he ever was living in dungeons and caves.
        Josh - A well-mannered ogre. Runs a small tavern on the edge of town, and it's clear that he puts a lot of love into it. His family was kidnapped for a gladiatorial arena, meant to test fighters prowess. Josh could never really stand the sight of blood, so he opted to take on the position of cook for the combatants in the arena. He's very self-conscious about his size, but he's a gentle giant, and a friendly soul. Speaks with a slight New Zealand accent.
        Weiss and Jaded - an Aasimar and Tiefling Wife/Husband duo. Weiss mans the bar putting patrons to ease with her holy feminine charm while Jaded in the back is the Cook and Brewmaster known for his signature drink Devil Rose Ale. If asked about their relationship they'll simply state that it was originally a joke to screw with friends but they learned to truly love each other.
        Lurag Strongbrew - Lurag is a retired Dwarven barbarian. He made it his mission in life to find the lost mead recipe of the legendary Dwarven brewer, Gilgoth Honeybeard. Once he retrieved it, he settled down and opened a tavern to share the legendary brew with the world.
        Meef, Störsk, and Gjël - A trio of gnomes who take turns bussing tables, cooking, and bartending. Tavern is built into the bottom of a cliff-face and the goblins added wooden structure to turn a large hollow into a serviceable, if somewhat cramped for medium and larger characters.

        Umlog and Nevell aka 'the beauty and the beast'. Umlog is a literal troll, yet an extraordinary one. He's as intelligent as a troll can be and actually not a bad fellow. He is well read and has particularly deep knowledge of local laws. He acquired his tavern in a remote deal via an exchange of letters. No one knew a troll was the buyer, before the deal was done. People in this area -close to the feywoods- are very keen on honoring deals and contracts and thus, somewhat begrudgingly abstained from gathering their torches and pitchforks. The success of the 'Green side of Life' -that's the name of the tavern- is not only based on Umlog's craftiness, though. A nymph named Nevell works in the tavern at the side of Umlog. She is hospitality personified, a skilled chef, baker and singer. Nobody except them seems to know how they ended up together, but they run a really homely place in a village on the edge of civilization.
        Pierce 'Ears' Moldun, a balding human with normal sized, non-pierced ears, is the owner of Sweet Relethe. He is always looking down, at the drink he is pouring, the bar he is polishing, or the food he is cooking. He is a man of few words. Tell him, 'Ears, I need to give away a story,' and leave a proper sum on the bar. You will know what his service is worth if you truly need it. It may be expensive, but rarely more than one can pay. The price is different for every story, but if you do not offer enough, he will know after a quick glance at you. He will shake his head and continue with his work. If your coin is sufficient, he will nod his head, then get the dark blue bottle down from the top shelf. Slowly. Carefully. The bottle is beautifully made, but you find yourself unable to describe it apart from the color. He will pour a tiny shot, small as a thimble, before replacing the bottle and pulling you a beer to go with it. He will tell you that it's best to drop the shot in the beer then drink it slowly as you tell your story. It is best to trust him on this. As you begin your story, he will look up at you with eyes the same color as the bottle, and you will not be able to look away. He will listen intently as you tell your story, and as the words pass your lips they will also pass out of your memory. The regulars say that even if someone is sitting right next to you, they will not hear a word, just the quiet mumbling of a slow moving river. You will leave Sweet Relethe no longer possessed by your story, not in the slightest upset at your expenditure, and quick to recommend Ears of Sweet Relethe to anyone who seems in need of his service.

        Arthur 'Art' Igneous Ficer - Art is a an average sized fellow with sallow skin and sunken eyes. To give you an idea of his general appearance: despite owning a bar and inn for travelers, it looks like Art is the one that really could use some rest. But Art is a pleasant man with a passion for magically enchanted items. He gladly will talk to any traveler with such an item about the item. He finds it all fascinating. He will tell you that he used to dabble a little, but he couldn't find too many volunteers. So, he opened a bar and inn, and that pays pretty well. He keeps the price low, and that keeps travelers coming in. If you decide to stay for the night, all weapons need to be left in his care before you head up to your rooms. He's had too many drunken fights break out in the dormitory area, he will tell you. For any party member that blacks out at the bar or decides to stay the night, the DM must roll a D4 when the party member checks out of the inn. You see, Art never did give up his love of magic item creation, and he is desperately working on figuring out how to enchant weapons and items in a single night. DM rolled a 4? Surprise! An item of yours, at the DM's choosing, has acquired a properly functioning effect, also of your DM's choosing! Rolled a 3? Well, it's the same as 4, except the DM will also roll a 1d10 on your every use/attack, and a 1 will mean that your item misfired in wild magic (DM's choice). A 2? Oof. Well, it is the same as rolling a 3, except your item is completely unmagical except for the 1d10 chance of wild magic. And if the DM rolls a 1, then you were significantly robbed of either money or an item. Making magical weapons and items costs a lot, after all, and Art has a bit of rogue in him, it seems. Also, for any night a party member stays at the inn, there is a 1d6 chance of an unsatisfactorily explained small fire breaking out overnight. The following morning after such a fire, Art normally looks a little worse for wear.

In fact anyone who stays in 'The Pocket' for long enough will find their actions more rhythmic than usual, joining in a symphony of synchronized cutlery clanking, mastication, foot tapping under harmonizing musical conversations and even melodious arguments. Modeus takes extra delight in serving Bard patrons who bring their own instruments and will offer discounts and advice in return for a quick performance.
        Krall Razorthorn - Former half-orc warrior turned tavern owner, he exchanged his armor for a tuxedo. He runs a high class tavern called The Silk Sheik Tavern, specializing in dainty cocktails and high end drinks.
        Borgrarg - Having amassed a fortune adventuring, this dwarf opened Drink. The tavern hasn't make so much as a copper piece in 4 years. He's been drunk all this time giving away drinks to anyone who walks in the door. Lucky for him, he's located in a small village, now known for its sobriety.
        Marty Oggbin - smallish, middle-aged human, with a slight hunch on his back. Born and raised locally. Marty is forever the optimist and mysteriously manages to spin any traveler's downtrodden tale. He often gives away food to those most in need.
        Breena Timbers - a forest gnome whose curiosity took her far and wide. She opened a tavern to meet as many interesting people as possible and hear their tales. She has a propensity to accidentally sneak up and startle people, and is a eavesdropping addict. Her smile is warm, her laughter is infectious, and her hospitality is unmatched.
        Khim - A sarcastic old Goblin with a bold head, bushy mustache and a peg leg. As a former adventurer, he seems to have all the stories a low- party could ask for. Nobody really knows how old he really is, but had this tavern for at least 20 years. Its also a favored spot for rogues and rangers in town.
        Gimble Scheppel - a forest gnome that owns the Kobold's Lair, a rough and rowdy tavern for the every day man. He is playful, likes pranks, and makes it his business to know EVERYONE that enters his tavern. He bought the tavern using money made as a spy/assassin in his past. He has mostly cleaned up now though, mostly...
        Brock and Brady Yorin -These fraternal twin half-orcs started the 'Paper Lantern' as a pop-up tent following faires. They made sure to always take something local and not serve it until the next stop. After a few years they found they had enough currency put away to stop, and setup a place with actual walls. Now they import different brews and vintages from as far afield as they can, sometimes evening hiring on adventures for something rare or valuable. Their orc heritage shines through at night, in dim light, when their amber eyes watch you. And when they grin companionably at your tall tales, more than just incisors seem sharp. Skin that grey is a sign of sickness in others.
        Cret Episkop- A halfling who decided to open an inn in the center of Goliath settled lands. The bar counter upfront is nearly twice his height so there is a raised floor behind it. When asked why would he settle down here, he chuckles, and blushes, pointing out the tall Goliath barmaid serving the patrons and says she's his wife.

The boot is of high quality, but otherwise unremarkable", "A lighthouse, the light of which is an uncanny green. Its keeper is more than a little mad, and spends all day gathering fireflies and their grubs. At dusk the keeper places his daily catch in a fine-mesh cage at the lighthouse’s top.

    Dreamscape
        The childhood home of one of the party members.

        A crowded street where no one's face is in focus. They don't seem to perceive you.

        A prestigious looking academy. When you enter the grounds, all your clothes mysteriously vanish.

        The moon and sun are bouncy, 1940's cartoon versions of themselves.

        An embarrassing moment of one of the party members plays in a loop in the sky for a few minutes.

        Dead people from the story are seen walking by with their wounds still prominent and bleeding.

        A beloved childhood pet is in danger, but the character can only move in slow motion, like being stuck in glue.

        A baby is crying in distress. Every doorway the characters step through to try and find it takes them further away.

        A court room where the judge, the lawyers and jury all yell abuse at the characters. No-one will tell them what crime they're guilty of.

        An impossibly high tower that creaks and sways in the breeze. The only way to ascend is a staircase of rickety, rotten steps with frequent gaps.

        Albert Einstein, Adolf Hitler, Elvis Presley and Queen Elizabeth having dinner together.

        The party sees a table surrounded by people playing a weird game with pen & paper, several different kinds of dice, a great amount of books and miniatures.

        Suddenly a group of 5-6 people appearing out of nowhere all dressed in weird formal clothes all of which carry strangely shaped metal pipes and one of them a black box talking about having to enter the next dream level.

        A man dressed in a black leather cloak wearing a pair of strangely shaped black glasses giving the party the choice between a red and blue pill.

        A man who keeps appearing and offers them different types of cheese

        A giant floating baby head.

        Mailman knocks on door

        A dozen eggs, unpackaged

        The murder scene of a murder of crows

        A field of cows

        Dentist

        Barber

        Snakes hugging you with their metal arms

        Fluffy clouds

        A giant boat

        A fish

        Cute Christmas critters which are secretly super evil.

        A sleeping eldritch entity, but the pillows and blanket are pink.

        An incubus/succubus who seems lost or has given up.

        The thought police doing surveillance of people's dreams.

        The players find themselves only able to travel along a two dimensional plane. They have been transformed into characters in a painting.

        Child versions of the party, armed with toys and dressed in “cheap costume” versions of the counterpart PC’s equipment (a tablecloth instead of a cloak, aluminum foil instead of body armor). They fawn over the party, especially so their older counterparts.

        A giant muffin wearing a chefs hat and apron who carries a tray which contains various peoples heads. All of them smiling quite happily. It’ll offer one of them to you if you approach.

        flaming meteors are falling like rain, they turn into cool sticky honey on contact

        Musical Accompaniment - Any time a character does something, inappropriately themed music plays (who knew eating rations was a death defying act!)

        Trees growing upside down, roots reaching for the sky

        Fish gliding through the air

        A portrait gallery featuring all the members of the party in their most embarrassing moments

        A portrait gallery featuring all the members of the party in their most heroic moments

        A turtle riding a giant quesadilla

        A guy with a trombone on his head and cymbals for hands

        The party encounters a version of themselves, but in negative colours

        A bear in a tracksuit cooking cookies

        Giant dominoes falling

        A pair of bickering twins give you a"routine traffic stop" with no visible road

        Some ghouls on a picnic

        A Dragonborn family quite happily enjoying a breakfast of assorted teeth, baked or prepared into several dishes.

        A lake full of floating rubbish.

        Walls that seem to fold and unfold on themselves, never seeming to change or reveal anything

        Absurdly large fruit dangles from nearby plant life. Basketball-sized apples make tree branches droop and baseball-sized berries pull bushes to the ground.

        Absurdly large fruit dangles from nearby plant life. Basketball-sized apples make tree branches droop and baseball-sized berries pull bushes to the ground.

        Inappropriately sized animals walk by; a cat-sized deer, a moose-sized raccoon, a mouse-sized owlbear.

        Everything in the world appears to be candy-coated, with thick layers of sticky honey or hard sugar shells. As you touch them, you cannot feel this effect; it's purely visual.

        Trees and plants appear to be slowly growing backward, getting smaller, and leaves returning to buds.

        The sky appears to be the surface of the ocean like you're walking on the bottom of the ocean, but there is no water.

        Giant, iridescent beetles surfing through the ground like its water

        Someone from your distant past is here. They have a completely different relationship with you than you remember.

        You finally got that thing you need/want, but it is slippery and heavy and sometimes too large. If you stop looking at it it disappears.

        There's another party and they are better than you in every way. They are good at what you are bad at, and better at what you thought you were great at. Your patron is over there with them, laughing together, bedecking them in regal furs and shiny gear. Trusted NPCs whisper to them while glowering at you. They always have their backs to you and you can never get close to them.

        A harried stage hand/porter/person runs up. It is time. Everyone is waiting. You better get out there and do it. There is no time to prepare, no it has to happen now.

        You are in that house again. It is bigger than you remember even though you know it quite well. Except for this doorway. Or that staircase. All this old stuff has been there the whole time, how come you never noticed it before?

        All your teeth fall out and your fingernails grow really long

        Really have to pee but people keep coming up to talk to you/other obstacles preventing this

        A blue giraffe with a super long neck that reaches into the sky, grazing on clouds instead of trees

        MC Escher staircase loops back on itself if walking upwards, but goes somewhere else if walking downwards

        A woman swims the backstroke through a field of tall grass as if it were water. She calls out and invites you to join.

        Someone close to you shows up, and begins speaking with urgency, but the words are lost as their teeth drop out and turn into ladybugs.

        Rapidly forming clouds begin to rain upward into the sky. The storm clouds will occasionally throw lightning and thunder upwards, in time.

        The bees arrive and inform you in their thousandfold buzzing voices that you are late for your appointment and if you don't hurry, you will incur late fees.

        A large imposing piano sounds out a baleful melody which vibrates the land, and twists the plants nearby to it's rhythm.

        A friendly child, who leads you to a feast, and motions for you to sit down. You are magically compulsed to do so, should you choose not to do so willingly. They motion for you to dig in, and once you take your first bite, you see that you are truly eating the corpses of your family.

        A known NPC pleading with you that they are trapped in the dream world and an imposter is occupying their body in the real world.

        Hundreds of copies of a player character, all who act on a cascading delay, exactly like one of the players.

        A balding halfling in a hunting lodge speaking backward, standing behind him is an old woman with a log.

        The party must make a DC 10 Wisdom save or hallucinate that all their teeth are falling out (or some other recurring bad dream)

        Giant eggs that, after receiving a certain amount of damage, hatch into a random animal/monster, if one of the players says the creature's name then it will attack them

        Whales and dolphins flying through the night sky with star-like patterns in them

        An aubergine that will invert into a song about the inverters mother

        Familiar places to the party, like their home, and their favorite tavern are transformed into sets on a soundstage with television cameras and a live audience that applaud and laugh at the seemingly normal things the PCs says and does, like it’s a sitcom.

        Giant Insects

        Whispers of the dying

        Wild Animals Hunting you

        Omniscient Creatures that play with you as their pawn

        Timeloops

        Natural Disasters

        Warped/Painful versions of memories (e.g. childhood home, but burning and screams of people dying)

        Psychics that explore your subconscious

        (Un)holy Symbols, Prophecy, Omen

        Body Mutation / Modification (be mindful of your players, though.)

        Being Eaten by a Giant Creature

        Being Trapped inside of the dream

        Foreshadowing/red herrings, mix in potential scenes from further along in the campaign/adventure

        The sky is quickly moving between night and day, with an entire day cycle passing in the span of minutes

        A big fat bird with a crusty big beak (almost like a pelican) sits atop a nest planted directly on top of a group of stones that have formed almost a pedestal. Inside the nest, the bird sits atop a giant egg. Something of interest is in the egg if it is broken open.

        Out of place scene, if in a fantasy world, describe a sci-fi world (without using modern words), or if in a sci-fi world, describe a fantasy world

        Players are experiencing the perception of another character, either in real-time or from some previous significant event. Or it’s just of some drunkard getting wasted and cavorting about town before puking & passing out. Could be used to reveal places of interest the players have stumbled upon themselves yet.

        A musical group/orchestra is playing a song that makes no sense, and the lyrics are the viewers own thoughts, sung back to them.

        A giant being sits at a table for dinner, eating screaming men, women, and children as casually if they were eating a salad. In between bites, they’re describing something in a tongue that sounds like Common, but none of the words are making sense (“Prisencolinensinainciusol”)

        The dreamer walks through a hall of horrific statues, all looking at the dreamer. Out of the corner of their eye, they’re constantly sensing movement all around them, but as they turn to look, there’s nothing there save for the statues, except the statues seemed to have moved slightly differently than they were before. The statues are getting closer.

        A God from the setting mythology beckons the player to join them at a table for a game of <whatever>, this game ends up having some sort of real world consequences.

        `DThis Idol’s Power Is:`,
            `Corpses in its vicinity spontaneously generate eggs that hatch into monsters that vaguely resemble living versions of the idol.`, `Anyone who sleeps near it gains no rest, and instead is puppeted through their dreams to build a temple from nearby materials to house the idol. If one is already complete they instead participate in unsettling rites within.`, `Anyone who spills at least 1 HD of blood (it doesn’t matter who from) on the idol can reroll a failure that day which involves (1d6): 1, betrayal; 2, darkness; 3, suffocation or swallowing; 4, hunting; 5, secrets; 6, magic.`, `A random animal species near the idol will gradually grow in intelligence and have their anatomy twisted into a vaguely humanoid posture. Animals so affected become convinced of their divine right to usurp humanity.`, `Anyone who looks directly at it must save vs. poison or be disabled for a round vomiting (1d4): 1, alien ichor; 2, dust; 3, iridescent fumes; 4, light which illuminates nothing but itself.`, `Anyone who casts a spell involving (1d6): 1, parasites; 2, cold; 3, souls; 4, decay; 5, enslavement; 6, warping space and time, near the idol has their caster level count as 2 levels higher for that spell.`, `It is but one part of a great and terrible panoply. Anyone who holds the idol gains a sense for the location of the other objects of this panoply, which are all potent artifacts in their own right.`, `It subtly increases entropy in its surroundings. People and things fall apart just a little faster, and complex organizations like governments dissolve into chaos.`, `When the heart of a magic-user (or similarly magical being) is sacrificed to the idol, it summons a guardian which vaguely shares its own aesthetic. This guardian has the same HD and spells as the possessor of the heart that was sacrificed to it, and knows no loyalty save to the idol. Another heart of at least the same HD must be fed to the guardian each month to prevent it from dissolving into protoplasm.`, `It calls swarms of poisonous and diseased vermin to worship at its base.`, `The longer it remains motionless, the more it distorts time in the area around itself. Each day (relative to the time outside its influence) that it’s kept still, time moves twice as fast as the outside world, maxing out at 100x the rate of the passage of time.`, `Everything within 1 meter of the idol is covered in a fungoid sludge that ruins rations and slowly ruins other supplies. This area of effect doubles every day that it is not moved beyond the area, to a maximum of 1 kilometer.`, `That spending longer than 1d6 hours within arm’s length of it fucks your afterlife up irrevocably. You’re going to one of those weird alien para-dimensions when you die, no matter what you do.`, `It’s a bomb. When it’s set off by (1d4): 1, complete immersion in fluid; 2, placement on holy ground; 3, struck by lightning; 4, exposed to dragon-flame, it bursts into reality-distorting static for 6d6 damage (exploding) to everything in a 100 meter radius.`, `If used to bludgeon someone to death, the bludgeoner swap any one of their attributes for one of the bludgeoned person or creature’s. The exchange lasts one day, and also you will see the being you bludgeoned to death staring accusingly at you when you dream for the rest of your life.`, `It trembles in the presence of other magic objects. If it touches one, that object is disenchanted as its power is drained to feed the idol. After 2d6 items are drained, an indiscriminately large disaster befalls an enemy (or at least annoying acquaintance) of the person who fed the latest magic item to it. Disasters could include everything from floods to demonic incursions.`, `Anyone who dies near the idol is preserved eternally in its collective dreamscape. Anyone who sleeps near the idol can access this dreamscape and meet anyone who’s died near it.`, `The first living thing to touch it in a day must save vs. magic or have their soul torn out of their body to feed the idol.`, `Once a day at midnight, the idol can be used to open a portal to another world for five minutes.`, `It is indestructible by mortal means, and anyone who tries to harm it or disrespect it must save vs. magic or be transmuted into a pillar of similar substance to the idol.`,

When asked where she gets her items from or why shes selling so low, she just says its a trade secret, regardless of how high you roll persuasion or intimidation. If you attempt to cast any spells on her to get more information, the spell will be resisted and she will politely ask you to respect her privacy. Upon further investigation, Martha is actually a night hag, and she crafts her items out of the nightmares she collects naturally from the townspeople around her to create items geared toward easing their anxiety. example: a man has a nightmare about his pants falling in public, so she creates and sells him a belt that will never fail to keep your pants above your waist. These items don't have any bad twists, and Martha genuinely just wants to run an honest business while helping the people around her.

Every flying insect, bug, creepy crawly, and flying vermin of size Tiny or smaller within a 40 foot cube centered on the frog is snatched by shadowy lashing tongues of force. After 1 hour, roll a d6. On a 5 or higher, the item creates 1d3 goodberries. The statue continue snatching insects for 1d4 hours after activation, a higher level spell slot multiplies the duration.

', 'The Burning Bell: A courtroom with a sinister looking, large-sized black-iron bell (with no clapper) with adamantine bands is mounted six feet above the floor in a central position. The bell weighs over 200,000 pounds and is twenty feet tall and ten feet across at the base. When rung, it peals at B♭-1 (14.5 Hz) and can be heard for up to 10 miles. While painfully loud, a strange property of the amphitheater is that it protects those inside it from the bulk of hearing damage from the bell's peal. A marble dais is built directly beneath the bell, while a second (more ornately carved) is nearby. The sound of the bell is almost completely muted while standing on either dias. The courtroom is shaped like an amphitheater, with rising levels of seating behind the second dias. The bell (and surrounding temple courtroom) is covered with bas-releif pictoglyphs in a forgotten tongue, the glyphs demonstrate a man standing burning beneath the bell, while those surrounding fall to thier knees. Spend a spell slot of at least third level, and the bell peals, sustaining itself for 3d6 minutes, a higher level spellslot multiplies the length of this effect. While active, anyone hearing the bell (including those on the dais) is under the effects of the spell Zone of Truth. Attempting to lie causes physical pain (and potentially damage) that increases to a maximum beneath the bell. Within the first d6 minutes, the Will DC beneath the bell is equal to the 16+caster's proficiency bonus. This decreases by 1 for every d6 minutes or 100 feet of distance (to a minimum of DC10). Those who lie while beneath the bell suffer 3d6 Sonic damage and 3d6 fire damage (reduced by 1d6 for every 10 feet of distance or d6 minutes, to a minimum of 2 sonic and 2 fire).

Anyone seated at the top of a pillar suffer the following effects (during) and up to 1d6 hours after leaving: Blinded (CON DC15 resist), Silence (WILL DC15 resist), and Slow (DEX DC15 resist). While seated at the top of the pillar, the creature gains ADV on sound based Perception checks and a +5 bonus, being able to hear even a whisper up to ten miles away, as if they were right next to the whisperer. Additionally, once per eight hours, the listener may use the effect of the spell Detect Thoughts against one creature they perceive within 1d6 miles.

Damaging or destroying the dollhouse deals an equal amount of damage to all within range. ',",

        Demonic-looking horns sprout from your forehead.

        You gain a forked tongue.
        You lose your nose and instead gain slit-like nostrils.
        You become almost skeletal, with white skin, no hair, and a gaunt stature.
        Your shadow seems darker and bigger than before. Sometimes it moves out of sync with your body.
        You appear superficially very attractive, but some people are revolted by you (sort of like psychopath sense).
        Your teeth become sharp points.
        Your nails grow longer and longer, and are impossible to cut.
        A small black spot appears somewhere on your body and grows.
        Your heart is turned to stone and you are unable to feel emotion.
        You are unable to withstand direct sunlight.
        You shed your skin all at once like a reptile and are vulnerable for a short period afterwards (alternatively, you build a cocoon and transform into... something else).
        You have an affinity with a type of bug like a cockroach, which you may eat, play with, see often, or which may emerge from your bodily orifices.
        Animals instinctively know you are evil/wrong.
        Plants that you touch wither and rot.
        Your eyes grow to be more bulbous, similar to a fish.
        One of your hands losses all bones and shifts into a writhing mass of tentacles.
        You begin to develop patches of only black scales that are contantly itchy. When scratched off, more grow to take their place.
        Your teeth shift in your mouth to sit at odd angles. This doesn't impact your ability to talk or eat, but it does five you a crooked smile.
        You begin to sweat a thin, clear grease. No matter how much you bathe you cannot get it off.
        Two new eyes grow in the palms of your hands. You cannot see out of them and they seem to move on their own freewill.
        Your spine arches outwards, giving you a severe hunchback. Looking closer reveals small spines protruding from your skin down your back.
        The palms of your hands are stained a deep red that is not able to be washed off.
        Your skin becomes cold and rubbery to the touch.
        Blood will occasionally leak out of various spots on your head (eyes, ears, nose, mouth). It is not enough to hurt you, but it is visible to others.

        Your body temperature is always burning hot or freezing cold.

        Your eyes glow with a hellish light.
        Your eyes change to empty sockets filled with absolute darkness or hellish light.

        Your skin color changes to something unnatural for your race (green, milk white, obsidian black, red, etc.).
        Your skin changes to scales (if you didn't have scales before).
        Your skin stretches and bulges as if there is something moving beneath it.
        Your teeth become shark-like, with extra rows of teeth.
        There is a literal gaping hole in your chest where your heart used to be.

        Your veins become visible through your skin; they might appear black, blue, green, red, or glowing.
        Your reflection shows a monster.
        Your shadow is shaped like that of a monster.

        Your mouth moves to your clavicle overnight and expands across the entire front of your throat as though your throat has been slit.
        You no longer gain sustenance from food or recuperate from rest. You begin to lose 1 permanent HP per day until the problem is solved or curse is lifted. Becoming an undead or aberration or finding alternative sources of nourishment may help you.
        When breathing out in cold weather, you exhale black smoke instead of white breath.
        You have no shadow. Even the natural shading of your body is gone, giving you an uncanny valley kind of appearance.
        Your blood loses all colour, your complexion is now unnaturally pale and ashy.
        Strange runes in a language foreign to you appear on random spots on your body. They appear to be trying to tell you somethig but you cannot descipher them.
        Shadows cling to your body, and aren't as easily dispelled by light.
        Anomalous orifices begin appearing on your body, such as mouths, eye sockets, etc.
        A tragedy/comedy masks appears over your face, which bleeds a black liquid from its openings.
        Your eyes are now tinted with a dull black, as if dampened. When you cry, it's almost as if the tears share the same color as your original eyes.
        Wisps of black smoke sift through the soles of your shoes whenever you walk.
        Whenever you voice echoes, it lasts for much longer than it normally should.
        Acts of humanity and decency now stain you. Tears apply permanent defects to your skin. Mercy and sparing aches your hand, and dimples become gnarly and wrinkled.
        Your presence dampens the weave around you, snuffing out simple cantrip effects such as dancing lights, prestidigitation, and mending.
        You hear the pulses of those near you. The heavy thuds of their hearts beat like drums drowning out ambient sounds.
        A loud crash shakes the establishment. It appears lightning struck the rooftop. This is the third time this week it’s happened while you were out and about.
        Your wrists can rotate all the way around.
        You slowly stop needing to move your mouth to talk.
        Amalgamation. You look like several parts from different creatures were spiced, stitched, or grown together to from one creature.
        Disproportional limbs. Ex: one overly large arm or one overly small leg.
        Strange bulbous pods growing on your skin. They seem to pulsate with your heart beat.
        When cut, you bleed black or green ichor instead of blood.
        When your skin gets damaged, it reveals a different type of creature underneath. This other creature appears to be wearing your skin like a disguise.
        Everybody who sees your eyes will believe that you are looking directly at them. (like it is with the mona lisa).
        Your skin turns clean and pure white. It's hard to the touch and slightly cold.
        An eye appears on the back of your neck. It's a bright acidic greenish yellow color.
        A strange symbol appears in the middle of the chest of whatever clothing you wear. If you put a coat over it, the symbol fades in on the surface of the coat over the course of a few minutes. If you take the coat off, it fades and is back on the shirt underneath again. When you strip naked, it fades in as a tattoo.
        Your hair becomes distressed and wirey no matter how much you tend to it, creating a knotted nest of bristly strands.
        Your saliva takes on an unnatural hue and can now be used as a weak venom.
        You gain a wheezing, hacking cough that eventually leads to strange objects and fluids being coughed up (I.e. tetromas, small statues and smoothed rocks, black sludge).
        You weep black, oily tears.
        Strange shapes begin to form beneath your skin, spelling out words as you run your fingers over them. The words urge you to commit dreadful acts.
        A hornet's nest forms within your body. The hornets come and go through holes at your collar bones. They are not hostile to you.
        While your appearance does not change, it becomes increasingly difficult for others to remember who you are. Over time, even your closest friends and family lose the ability to recognize or remember you.
        Your fingernails shed and regrow constantly. The process is neither clean nor painless.
        You develop a chronic irritation, such as itchy eyes, sore limbs/joints, or a mild rash. Careful observers will notice a very subtle movement at the location, akin to a worm moving under the surface.
        Your gait shifts as you move, most times in small increments similar to carrying a heavy object in a hand or dragging with a leg, but sometimes the shift is like some large entity actively pushing/pulling against you.
        Your body's symmetry is thrown askew. One arm is thicker, an eye is larger, a leg is now 1-2 inches longer/shorter, etc. This change affects 1d3 paired body parts or organs.
        A natural aura of darkness follows you. People always (mysteriously) find themselves standing in your shadow, a cloud passes over the sun/moon, or another person/object blocks the nearest light source when you get close.
        Your hair becomes overgrown and filthy quickly, and clumps come out effortlessly, but your hair never thins.
        You regularly regurgitate wads of hair, teeth, and toenail.
        When others look at their reflection in your eyes they see the moment of their own death.
        When you speak a second lower voice comes from your throat repeating the same words but in a croaking, droning melody.
        You seemingly aren't affected by wind. Your hair and clothes do not move in light winds, but you will still be affected by severe weather. (Alternatively, you and anything you're wearing are always blowing in wind).
        You no longer make noise breathing, coughing, sneezing, from your pulse, yawning, or from objects hitting you. You still make noise walking and verbally.
        You're facial features become more severe. Your jaw becomes more angular and long, you cheekbones become abnormally large, your forehead protrudes like a neanderthal, and your nose grows larger. Additionally, your fingers and toes grow longer.
        Your skin becomes slightly translucent, so your muscle tissue is visible. Optionally, your muscles are also clear, so you can see your bones.
        When you wake up from sleeping/trance etc. Your mouth is sewn shut, and your jaw is unable to open. The wire holding your mouth shut is durable, and takes 2d4 minutes to cut. Whenever you re-awaken, this happens again.
        The skin directly above your veins turns dark purple, perfectly tracing them. Your veins also protrude more. When you bleed, the veins in that area become black.
        You no longer need to blink nor close your eyes when you sleep. (You still have the awareness when sleeping that you would if your eyes were closed, though.) Your eyes become incredibly bloodshot and get worse every hour after you awaken.
        Your skin looks red and irritated, and you are hot to the touch. Any tears or sweat evaporates in a few seconds. When your blood is spilt, it appears to be boiling. The area around wounds that bleed blisters.
        Your skin becomes shiny, smooth, and is hard to the touch. When you are damaged, your skin cracks like ceramic. It still heals at its normal rate, but the materials needed to heal you without magic change. Your skin has permanent scratches unless healed magically.
        Your eye lashes turn into spider legs. They seem to move with a mind of their own. When one is pulled out it grows back in 2d4 hours.
    Omens
        Beware of the blinding red light. If you see this light, you must flee. It will only bring you death!
        You will find the answer to a long, mysterious riddle in your family bloodline buried between two oak trees, west of the village you grew up in.

        In the high plain there’s a dark moon. Don’t follow the light.
        When the dawn will come at the birthday of the mother, rats and snakes will devour all hopes.
        Near the montains, there is a grey falcon. Look at the eyes, and you’ll die. Look at the tail, and you’ll be rich.
        Don’t move when the night song come, or you’ll gain something you don’t want, and lost something you wanted to keep.
        Today was possibly the most important day of your life! Congrat.. oh… you missed it… tsk tsk tsk… What a shame… A do-over, then! Tomorrow you will wake up and it will be today. Make sure you return or that decree will stay. k, Bye!
        Do not trust your thoughts. They will hinder your victory.
        A figment in blue will cross your path tomorrow. You will know it when you see the sign. You must turn around 4 times and speak the following words:
        And through the drifts the snowy clifts Did send a dismal sheen: Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken The ice was all between.
        If you believe in telekinesis, raise my hand. The fortune teller then proceeds to raise their hand.
        When you are done, the spirit haunting will pass over you.

        Build Not Houses of White Stone.
        Three Coins Must Ye Pay; Three Prices Dear, Secrets Thrice Revealed, ‘ere The Light of Day.
        Gold, Silver, Copper; Never in the Opposite Order!
        Spill Forth a Dram for the Lost; Make Merry in the Name of Those Who Pay the Highest Price!
        You Must Seek the Leaf that Grows Not On Any Tree!
        Jump the Broom; Dance above the Blades!
        Sphinx of Black Quartz, Judge Thy Vow.
        Seek the Egg of Stone; Face the Dragon!
        Your nights will grow colder still, to match the heat of growing fires.
        Trust the twin with no siblings, but abhor the lone child.
        The face of the one you seek is thus- a busker at dawn; a composer at noon; a patron at dusk; a maestro under the stars.
        Your money, here, have it back. The fortune you’ve asked me to read, never shall I speak of it in this life or any hereafter.

        Poorly-dresed skanks like you will die alone. Naked, and alone. (Works best in an arctic setting, or not.)
        Never bring upon yourself the wrath of the chicken. You may think this a metaphor, but it is not. Their beaks are sharp like my toes.
        Your hands will taste of orange in the near future.
        That which you hold most dear will turn against you and lead you to ruin
        Your actions have had unintended and unforeseeable consequences, and have placed into action the final piece of that which now approaches you. You are the harbinger of your own death

        Fools will take great heed of your words. Use this to your advantage.
        A shrewd and very attractive fortune teller has put a curse on you. I will remove it for an additional sum.
        Trust not the travelers numbering odd.
        Take something old, give something new, doubt something red, trust something blue.
        Left at the stream, at the face look right, crawl through the dark, and you will find the light!
        Salt thy wounds, relish the sting, sweet is the knave, and bold is the king.
        Thrice will call the raven, heed its warn lest the fourth cry your dirge.
        Between silver and gold, choose evil’s bane. Between fire and chill, the lady’s kiss.
        The shadow of the dragon is an omen, but coming of the wolf is the sign.
        Begrudge not the thieving monkey, lest you take its place in the tiger’s jaws.
        Lay not your head in the barn animals’ bed, for the headsman soon calls.
        A copper for the maid, a silver to the beggar, and a gold for a lonely tune, may the vault of riches open to you.
        Someone you remember, someone you forget, someone with a favor, another with a threat.
        Poor fortune for ye, unless you confess your guilt to the willow tree.
        Your luck is a shame until you trade with your mate who has one of the same.
        A fortune most cold if you do as you’re told.
        Torch and candle, wax and wick, in the hall of fire, move right quick!
