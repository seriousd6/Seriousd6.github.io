/*
Beacons have access to a resource known as Light. Light
takes many different forms, and is unique to each Beacon.
Some are covered in cascading warm flames, while others
crackling with pure electric power. It gives them access to
their powers, bend fate in their favor, and even shrug off
death itself.
*/

/*
Force: Power, strength, emotion
Non-combat: Shouting a command to another, smashing
through a door or barrier, enduring a strenuous weight.
Combat: Devastating and destructive firearms, spraying a
room full of lead, smashing foes with whatever you have on
you.
Flow: Speed, reflex, cunning
Non-combat: Quickly climbing to the perfect vantage point,
threading the needle, avoiding harm or detection.
Combat: Running from one foe to the next, firing on a foe
before they can react, taking aim while leaping through the
air.
Focus: Patient, careful, precise
Non-combat: Carefully unlocking a console, assessing a
situation or location, knowing when to act.
Combat: Carefully aimed shots from your firearm, stabbing
into a weak point, using a foe’s mistakes against them.

Today, there are six known manifestations of the Light, six
classes of Beacon. Each is unique in its interpretation of the
Light, but all are bound with the responsibility of protecting
us.
Pyre towers above all others, a roaring inferno of
destruction. Amp acts in the blink of an eye, an electric
current on the battlefield. Nether calls upon the infinite
power of the void to warp reality. Wither is time itself,
inevitable and relentless. Fractal shatters the expectations
of everyone, bringing chaos to any situation. Shiver is ice
cold, locking down the plans of any who defy them.
You are one of those Beacons, an immortal guardian
infused with incredible power. As long as you have Light in
you, you refuse to die. Gather your squad and strike out into
the dark. There are ruins to explore, threats to fight back,
and mysteries to unravel.
*/

/*
Attribute: Approaches for acting.
Force: powerful, emotional, sweeping
Flow: reactive, quickly, effective
Focus: methodical, practiced, surgical
• Health: The amount of Harm you can take before dying.
• Light: A resource of great power flowing through the
Beacons.
• Status: A special effect inflicted on enemies, typically
interacting with a Beacon’s powers.
• Passive: Ongoing benefit unique to that class of
Beacon, specialized training.
• Melee: An action the Beacons can use when enemies
get too close for comfort.
• Powers: Incredible feats unique to the Beacon, only
possible because of the Light.
• Weapons: Armaments for the battlefield.

*/

/*
In addition, each class has a collection of Beats. Beats are
narrative accomplishments or goals that are related to the
class, and things that the Beacon must seek to accomplish
during a mission. Beats do not have a mechanical objective,
but instead are moments for the players to connect with the
narrative side of the game.
When a Beacon accomplishes a Beat, they’re able to
choose a new class Advance at the end of the mission.
Class Advances are one of the primary ways that Beacons
become more powerful. You can read more about all of the
different forms of advancement in the Advancement
section (page 75).
*/

/*
1. Choose a Class
There are six different types of Beacons, each serving a
different role on and off the battlefield. The Beacons are:
Pyre, Amp, Nether, Wither, Fractal, and Shiver.
Descriptions of the classes can be found on the following
pages.
Take the relevant Status, Passive, Melee, and Powers from
your class choice and put them on your character sheet
2. Define Characteristics
Set both Health and Light at the starting value of 2, and
then spend 6 points between the two however you would
like.
Next, set your Attributes. Force, Flow, and Focus each start
with a value of 1. You have 3 points to spend between the
three Attributes. No Attribute may have more than 4 points
during character creation.
3. Arm Yourself
Using the rules for generating random weapons (page 49),
create two guns. Choose one to keep as your starting gun,
and discard the other.
Your Beacon is lit, and ready to protect humanity and the
Lighthouse. If you want to jump right into a mission, you
can create one using the tools on page 64, or use the
example mission prompts on page 65.
