/*
At any time, a Beacon may spend a point of Light to:
• Reroll a roll
• Activate one of their Powers
• Resurrect with full Health
*/

/*
When a Beacon dies and resurrects using a point of Light,
they gain a point of Shade. A Beacon can only be
resurrected 3 times during a mission. If a Beacon has three
Shade and dies, they are lost, corrupted and roaming the
Sol system as a dangerous threat. For more on death and
dying as a Beacon, see page 15.
During a mission, for every point of Shade they have, a
Beacon must add an additional die to every roll. This is
called the Shade die. When rolling, if the Shade die has the
highest result, the Beacon takes 1 Harm, but also increases
the result by one step.
A failure (a result of 1-2) becomes a success with a
consequence (3-5), a success with a consequence
becomes a success (6), and a success becomes a critically
effective success (a demonstration of the raw elemental
power coursing through the Beacon).
All Shade is removed from a Beacon at the end of a mission.
The rest between missions allows them to rekindle their
bond with the Light, and purge the corruption.

/*
Beacons are incredible beings, capable of feats most of us
can only dream of. It isn’t a matter of if they can accomplish
something, it’s about how they accomplish it. When a
Beacon acts, how they describe the action decides which
Attribute they will roll.
