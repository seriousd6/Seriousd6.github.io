/*
If you would like to take your LIGHT campaign to the next
level, consider using these optional rules for tracking your
Beacons progress as the Sol system is invaded by enemy
forces.
These rules are not necessary for playing LIGHT, but can
provide higher stakes of play, and help weave together
interesting storylines as the Beacons and GM work out
which missions to take, and which they must let go.
This campaign mode tracks the status of the six major
locations in the Sol system, the places that humanity has
hold of: Mercury, Venus, Earth, the Moon, Mars, and the
Belt.
The system finds itself beset by enemy forces from all
sides. Over the course of the campaign, enemy forces will
vie for control over these locations, and the Beacons will
have to decide where to best focus their efforts of pushing
back.
*/

/*
The map of the Sol system shows the six locations for the
campaign. Each location has a Stability meter, and a place
to describe the current Faction and Invading Force.
At the start of your campaign, follow these steps together
to fill in the map and establish the initial state of the
system.


1. Establish Factions
Each location has one of humanity’s factions assigned to it.
They are responsible for its protection, or at least have a
major interest in the location.
Assign a faction to each location. Factions can be assigned
to more than one location. In this book there are three
factions of humanity to use: Wardens, Veil, and Rogues.
You may create your own factions if you’d like. Each faction
has a goal that they are moving towards, or a style of work
they typically employ Beacons for, represented by their
Bounties. Boons are small rewards that are given to the
Beacons after finishing Bounties.
If you have the LIGHT: Patrol Zones supplement, you can
use the factions that were created for each location.

2. Establish Invading Forces
Choose four of the six locations for the Invading Forces to
be first present on the map. For each location, assign one
of the following enemy factions: Corvus Dominion,
Reavers, Ruin, and Surge. Each enemy faction should be
assigned to one location.

3. Establish Stability
Each location has a Stability rating assigned to it to show
how big the threat currently is. The two locations without
Invading Forces have a starting Stability of +1.
For the remaining locations, assign one of the following
Stability ratings. Each of these must be used: -2, -1, +1, +2.
All locations in the system should now have a non-zero
Stability rating.

*/

/*
Control is a campaign format that follows this cycle:
1. GM creates a number of possible missions
2. Beacons choose and play a mission
3. The map is updated based on their choices and actions
This process is repeated as the map shifts with each
mission and choice.

*/

/*
The rules earlier in the book provide guidance on how to
create missions for LIGHT. There are some changes to
consider when playing in a Control campaign.
The location where missions take place now matters a
great deal. The GM may randomly determine which
locations to use, or choose. When choosing locations, it is
recommended to choose one with a positive Stability, one
with a negative Stability, and one at or close to neutral.
Normally during mission generation the enemy faction is
randomly determined. Instead, use the faction that is the
current Invading Force, if there is one. If there isn’t, choose
either a faction that is not currently invading any locations,
or a faction from a neighboring location and assign it as the
new Invading Force.
Before each session, the GM should create 3 missions, as
the Beacons will need to decide which they will pursue, and
which they will let slip by.
*/

/*
The GM should provide a brief pitch for each of the
missions that are currently available in the system. Once
presented, the Beacons must decide what to do with them.
One mission will be neutralized, another engaged, and the
last one will be failed.
When a mission is neutralized, it is neither a success or
failure. The threat has been held at bay, but still remains
looming. The location has no change to its Stability rating.
Neutralized missions can be presented again by the GM in
future sessions.
When a mission is engaged, that is the mission that you will
play out using LIGHT. Engaged missions are the only
missions that you can succeed at, and help bring stability
back to the location. Once the engaged mission has been
played by the group, determine if it was successful or
failed.
Successful missions increase the location’s Stability +1.
Failed missions, whether failed after engaging, or chosen
as the failed mission during selection, decrease the
Stability of the location -1.
*/


/*
Stability is a representation of how much control humanity
and the Beacons have over a location. This rating changes
as the Beacons succeed and fail missions across the
system.
Stability ranges from -3 to +3.
Stability provides a narrative direction for the GM to use
when running missions. It also affects the mechanics of
running a mission, and the rewards and advancement that
come after.
Positive Stability
Locations with a positive Stability rating are places where
humanity has a strong hold. That doesn’t mean they are
entirely safe, of course, but they are safer than many other
places. Enemy forces have been pushed to the edges, and
look for an opportunity to strike again.
Positive Stability affects missions in the following ways:
• Roll on the Bonuses table (page 64) before starting the
mission
• If the mission is successful, Beacons generate two
Guns and choose which to keep for loot
Negative Stability
Locations with a negative Stability rating are places where
enemy forces have managed to establish a foothold.
Enemies are everywhere, and humanity is being attacked
from all sides.
Negative Stability affects missions in the following ways:
• Roll on the Challenges table (page 64) before starting
the mission
• Beacons cannot roll on a Loot Table at the end of
missions
*/


/*As you play out a Control campaign, there will be important
shifts in the Stability of locations as the Beacons decide
which missions to engage with. Sometimes this means a
location is lost, and other times it means pushing out
invading forces.
Lost Worlds
If a location ever reaches -3 Stability, it is Lost. When this
happens, the location is effectively removed from the map.
In addition, every location adjacent to the Lost location
(e.g. Mercury -> Venus) loses -1 Stability immediately. If
this means that location is reduced to -3 Stability, it is also
Lost, and the effect is repeated.
If Earth is ever lost, the Lighthouse has fallen, and the
campaign ends as the Light is snuffed out.
The GM may decide to create a mission that allows a
location to come back from being Lost. If they do, it should
be especially difficult for the Beacons. Show them what
happens when the enemy has an opportunity to dig in and
prepare themselves.

Ejecting Invading Forces
When a location goes from negative Stability to neutral, the
Invading Force has been forcibly removed. The Lighthouse
must focus its efforts on saving those planets being
invaded much more so than those more under our control.
This gives the region some much needed stability, and
Beacons are rewarded for doing so.
When an Invading Force is ejected, nearby enemy forces
take note, and begin to lose ground. The Beacons may
choose one adjacent location to immediately gain +1
Stability. If that location is currently being invaded by the
same enemy faction as the one being repelled, the adjacent
location gains +2 Stability instead.
If this increase in Stability would bring a location from -1 to
neutral, then the effect is repeated.
Ending the Campaign
There is only one specific trigger for ending a Control
campaign: losing Earth. Victory is not defined. It is up to
you as a table to decide when you have “won” the
campaign, or if that is even possible. Perhaps the Beacons
will always be in an eternal war to defend the Lighthouse.
Or maybe they can finally bring peace to the system.

*/

/*
The Novae are normally a small, but highly dangerous
supplementary force found in missions. But if you would
like to incorporate them in a bigger way into a Control
campaign, these additional optional rules will allow you to
do so.
During the map creation, or any point after, the GM should
determine the Novae surge point. Earth cannot be a surge
point unless it currently has negative Stability. This
location has an especially high presence of Novae,
alongside whatever enemy faction is currently assaulting
it. This will have three effects.
First, the location immediately loses -2 Stability. If this
causes it to drop to -3, then the immediate locations also
suffer as per the Control rules. Second, the enemy faction
at the surge point is boosted across the system. Any
missions at locations where they are present require an
additional roll on the Challenge table, even if they have
positive Stability.
Lastly, the Novae will always be present at missions at this
location, and should appear in small numbers in the
adjacent locations. Their scouts are on the move, and the
Beacons should notice.
But not all hope is lost for the Beacons. Each location can
be pushed back once it becomes a surge point by
completing a Singularity Mission.

Singularity Mission
Singularities are warping megastructures that the Novae
create when they touch down at a location. They house the
Novae’s dangerous secrets and technology, and empower
their forces.
Once a location has become a Bastion (+3 Stability), a
Singularity mission can be attempted. These are the most
dangerous missions that the Beacons can go on, but if they
are successful, the Novae will be removed from the
location permanently.
A Singularity mission is a special type of mission the GM
will prepare, instead of preparing the usual selection of 3
missions for a Control campaign.
When designing a Singularity mission, instead of
determining a single type of mission, Singularity missions
are always all four: Investigate, Establish, Terminate, and
Recover, in that order.

Consider these factors when designing the mission:

Investigate: Finding a safe location near a Singularity is
difficult. Even on Bastion planets, the Novae attract
followers to protect them. Finding a location, and a “safe”
path to the Singularity is the first priority. Where is the
Singularity blind to the Beacons? What will confuse its
gaze?

Establish: The Beacons will need to establish a base.
During this process, they also need to synthesize a
weapon, tool, or component needed to kill the heart of the
Singularity when they breach it. Discuss this tool. What
does it look like? What is needed to make it? How is it used?

Terminate: The heart of the Singularity must be killed to
drive away the Novae. In order to do so, the Beacons will
need to breach through waves of enemies, and the largest
concentrations of Novae they’ll have ever seen. When they
arrive at the heart, they ’ll use the tool they built earlier. But
there is an unknown cost. What does the Singularity require
of the Beacons before it will it allow itself to die?

Recover: From the ruined corpse at the center of the
Singularity, a dark gift waits for the Beacons. One way or
another, they need to extract it and return it to the
Lighthouse. It can’t be left behind for the enemy to get, and
the Lighthouse will be able to either research it, or destroy
it. The gift looks different every time, and marks the
Beacons when they take it. The mark glows in the presence
of Novae. What promises does the gift make to you, if only
you’d embrace it?

nding a Singularity
If the Beacons can manage to complete a Singularity
mission, the Novae cannot appear at that location again.
Perhaps if they can do this at every location, the system
will finally be free of the star drinkers.
