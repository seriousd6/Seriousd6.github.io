/*
DISTANCE & RANGE

LIGHT focuses on quick, narrative, and dangerous combat
as the Beacons face off against the enemies of humanity.
Because LIGHT assumes use of theater of the mind, you do
not need a battlemap to run combat. Instead, distances
between targets and locations are abstracted out into
different ranges.
• Close: Within melee range, a step or two away.
• Mid: Anywhere within a standard sized room, a short
sprint away.
• Far: Across a large hall or field, or down a long corridor.
• Beyond: Anything beyond Far and out of range for
Beacons.

/*
There is no turn order used in LIGHT. Instead, the Beacons
act when they are ready to, or when the GM presents them
with a situation to react to. Combat begins when the
Beacons and their enemies are attacking one another.
When a Beacon acts in combat, they can always do two
things: move, and take an action:
Moving
When a Beacon moves, they reposition themselves on the
battlefield. Beacons can only shift from one range to the
next, so they can move closer or further away from a target
by one range. For example, a Beacon can move from Far to
Mid, or from Far to Beyond, but not from Far to Close.
Taking Actions
A Beacon may also take an action during their turn. An
action is when the Beacon needs to roll the dice for
something, or when they activate one of their Powers. For
example, using one of their guns to attack an enemy, or
smashing through a barrier.

/*
HARM, DEATH, RESURRECTION
During combat, the Beacons and enemies deal damage to
one another, called Harm. Weapons and Powers specify
how much Harm they deal when used, and enemies have a
set amount of Harm they deal whenever they act.
A character’s Health is reduced by the amount of Harm they
take. If an enemy’s Health ever reaches 0, they are dead, or
otherwise incapacitated. If a Beacon’s Health reaches 0,
they fall, but can be resurrected by marking a point of
Shade. Resurrected Beacons regain all of their Health and
Light.
As noted in the Shade section (page 9), a Beacon can
resurrect three times during a mission. If they try to
resurrect a fourth time, they are lost…

/*
The GM does not have a turn during combat, but instead
moves the spotlight of the fight from one Beacon to the
next.
Enemies in LIGHT have actions, which describe how they
typically act and react during a fight. The GM uses these
actions most typically as a reaction to a Beacon’s roll.
Whenever a Beacon’s roll has a consequence, the GM
throws danger back at the Beacons through the use of
enemy actions and other environmental threats.
There may be times where the GM wants to be more
proactive during combat. This is especially helpful to
demonstrate a particularly dangerous threat, or
overwhelming force. Doing so should be used as an
opportunity to forecast danger to the Beacons.

/*
Combat in LIGHT can be difficult for some GMs who are
used to a more structured combat system. There are no
maps or turn order. Instead, you as the GM are largely
playing a reactionary role in combat, moving and using the
enemies as a result of Beacon rolls, as opposed to having a
turn of your own.
But remember, there are always good odds that an action
from a Beacon will result in a consequence, even if it is also
a success. In fact, consequences are a part of any roll 1-5.
When reacting to a roll, you can use any of the enemies on
the field. Use these opportunities to make an unexpected
play, or to pose a threat somewhere else rather than always
reacting to the rolling player.
You can, if you want and the table agrees, take a more
active role in combat. I wouldn’t suggest going so far as to
having a “turn” of your own, but you may decide to move or
activate more enemies than one in reaction to a roll. Or, you
may decide to have an enemy act occasionally between
Beacon turns. Doing this sporadically, instead of regularly,
will make those actions feel more impactful, as they will
disrupt the flow of the Beacons and make them reconsider
their next actions
