/*
In LIGHT, there are many different types of guns. These
types provide basic information for how the weapon
functions, but they can be modified with time through the
use of Tags.
A gun has the following:
• Name: What people typically call this type of weapon
• Harm: Amount of Harm dealt when used
• Range: The range that the weapon is effective at
• Tags: Modifiers that define and change the way the gun
works

Vulcan is the most skilled gunsmith on Earth, possibly the
whole Sol system (though don’t let the forges on Mars hear
you say that). If you want a gun customized to spec, you
come to Vulcan.
Over the course of play, Beacons earn weapons (page 56)
that they might not want to hold onto. They can trade those
weapons into Vulcan between missions. Each weapon
traded in this way earns them one point of Favor with the
gunsmith. Favor can be spent the following ways.

1 Favor
Replace Tag: Choose an existing Tag on a gun and replace it
with a Tag of your choice.
Random Tag: A random Tag is added to your gun, as long as
you have space for it. The GM will randomly select a Tag for
you.
2 Favor
Random Weapon: Randomly generate a weapon. This gun
automatically has the additional Tag from step two.
New Look: Remove all Tags from the gun, and replace them
with Tags of your choice.
3 Favor
Custom Weapon: Choose the gun type and two additional
Tags. This gun can go beyond the normal limitations of 3
tags

Legendary Weapons:
Some guns have a reputation. Perhaps they were used by
an important Beacon, or were crucial in the success of a
history defining mission. Either way, these guns are
considered legendary.
Legendary guns follow all of the same rules as other guns,
but also have an additional Passive that sets them apart
from other weapons.
On the next page, you’ll find some examples, though you
are sure to discover more of them yourself.

Fang
Revolver, 2 Harm, Close, Ravenous.
Devour: Recover 1 Health when killing an enemy with Fang.

ADAPT
Sniper Rifle, 3 Harm, Far, Stationary, Scoped.
Aim Assistant: Treat 4-5 rolls as 6s when taking Focus shots.

Bow, 2 Harm, Mid/Far, Reload.

Loot
LIGHT gets its inspiration from “looter shooters” where
collecting lots and lots of treasure is the main incentive of
play. While Beacons do technically advance through class
Advances after missions, as well as working with factions,
loot will be their most consistent advancement.
For a large part of the game, Beacons will be trading in
weapons to Vulcan so that they can customize their favorite
weapons exactly the way they want. In addition, they will
want to collect a decent variety of weapons, so that they
bring the best weapons for the job.
As the GM, you have a few ways that you can help create an
exciting loot experience for the players.
First, the loot table at the end of missions. Allowing
Beacons to potentially score big with a customized table is
a lot of fun, and also a way to differentiate the missions. A
particularly dangerous mission might have a very lucrative
loot table, while straightforward missions might not even
have one.
When a loot table is on the line, the players know they are
in for a treat. You may even find fun ways to allow the
players to better their odds when rolling on the table. An
example would be giving them reroll for completing
secondary objectives during the mission.
Second is with legendary weapons. There are some
example legendaries in this book, but they are just the
starting point. Coming up with ways to create brand new
legendary weapons can be an exciting part of mission prep.
Before a big mission, think about what kind of weapon tech
the Beacons could secure if they are successful.
You don’t even need to make a brand new weapon! Players
with weapons they are really fond of can be rewarded by
eventually earning a legendary weapon status, giving the
weapon a unique perk unlike any other gun and securing its
place in history.

/*
There are so many places in LIGHT for you and the players
to create new things for the game. New gun types, tags,
and legendary weapons are ways to keep your loot
experience feeling fresh as well as keep the players hungry
for more. New enemies within the factions, or new factions
entirely will keep the Beacons on their toes every time they
go into combat. Not only that, but creating new class
powers, or even entire subclasses creates new ways for the
players to engage with the game.
It would take an entirely different book to give you all the
advice you’d want or need to make things for LIGHT.
Instead, I say to you that the best path forward with that is
doing it together with your friends. Lean into the fun and
what’s cool, not what feels fair or balanced. Let the
Beacons be powerful. Let the loot flow. And let the enemies
find new ways to make the Beacons reach for their Light.
