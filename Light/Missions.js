/*
The gameplay loop of LIGHT centers around Beacons going
on missions. Typically, a session of LIGHT looks something
like this:
1. The GM briefs the Beacons on the available missions
2. The Beacons choose one, and go complete it
3. The GM generates loot for the Beacons and debriefs the
party

*/

/*
The GM tells the Beacons about what missions are
available, and the group decides which one to pursue. After
doing so, the Beacons must choose which weapons from
their arsenal to bring with them. Each Beacon only brings 2
weapons with them on a mission.
After the briefing, the Beacons should remind themselves
of which Beats they have left to accomplish. While they
don’t have to declare which Beat they want to attempt to
fulfill during a mission, it helps to have an idea.
*/

/*
With the mission and weapons selected, the Beacons go
out and complete the mission. This will be the majority of
your play session. Details on some elements typically
found in a mission can be found later in the Mission
Creation section.
*/

/*
After a mission, the Beacons receive their rewards in the
form of loot and advancement.
*/

/*
Every Beacon receives one randomly generated gun (page
49). In addition, the GM may prepare a loot table for the
Beacons to roll on to receive additional rewards. Loot
tables are not required, and may be saved for particularly
difficult missions, but they can also be a way to shake up
the gameplay loop for the players.
Here are some things you may consider including on a loot
table, as well as an example table:
• Additional randomly generated guns
• Specific Tags
• Additional faction favor
• Legendary weapons
• Temporary power ups
*/

/*
d6 Loot
1 Medkit: Recover 3 Health. One use.
2-3 Random gun
4-5 +1 Faction favor

*/

/*
In addition to loot, Beacons can gain Advances. After a
mission, if a Beacon has accomplished one of their Beats,
they may select one of their Advances. A Beacon may only
satisfy one Beat during a mission. See Growth (page 75)
for more details on all the ways a Beacon improves over
time.
*/


/*
Each mission is unique, though they share many common
features. To create a mission, the GM should first choose a
faction (page 67) to offer the job to the Beacons.
Next, choose the type of mission. There are four standard
types of mission, though you may change them, blend
them, or even create your own:
• Termination
• Investigation
• Recovery
• Establish

After selecting a type of mission, make sure that you have
ideas for the three essential parts. These parts include
fighting, exploration, and wells. Each GM prepares
missions differently. Some prefer to write the entire
mission out, while some prefer a few notes. Choose the
method that works best for you.
You can also use the tables on page 64 to quickly create a
mission, or use them to build out a mission of your own
creation.
One last consideration for preparing a mission is
considering the loot reward for the Beacons. All Beacons
receive one randomly generated gun for completing
missions, but you may want to provide opportunities to
receive even more loot. See Loot for ideas (page 56).


*/

/*
TERMINATION
The most common mission involves the elimination of
enemy forces from a location. This may mean cleaning out
a group of encamped enemies, or hunting down and
eliminating an important target.
Termination missions are focused on a lot of combat, and
so the Beacons should be ready for a lot of fighting.
Spending their Light is made even more precious, and they
will need to learn to approach each fight tactically instead
of rushing in guns blazing every time.

Investigation
Scouting missions are often the starting point for a
Beacon’s career. Rather than throw them directly into the
fight, the Lighthouse would prefer they find the fight for
others. The intel gathered during these missions is crucial
for humanity to stay one step ahead of its enemies.
Investigation missions can be dangerous, so treat them
with care. They may involve the Beacons going into
uncharted territory, and a firefight might lead to them
being quickly overwhelmed by an unseen threat.

Recovery
At the pinnacle of our golden age, we had established
ourselves across most of the Sol system. Now, many of our
old holdings are lost, overrun by our enemies from beyond.
Someone needs to get them back.
Recovery missions take Beacons to abandoned facilities, or
locations now home to our most dangerous enemies. Inside
is something valuable, another piece as we rebuild
ourselves. In recovery missions, Beacons explore mazelike and dangerous structures in order to uncover the
things we’ve lost.

Establish
Our network of trusted and secure locations across the
system is dwindling. The Lighthouse needs to plant roots
on every strategic planet and moon if it’s going to
effectively mobilize the Beacons.
Establish missions send Beacons to dangerous or
uncharted territory. Working with the environment around
them, the Beacons will need to construct and defend a
permanent foothold that future Beacons can count on.

/*
COMPONENTS OF A MISSION
Once you’ve selected your mission, you’ll need to build it
using the following pieces. While you aren’t required to
include all of them, they provide a means of changing up
the feel of a mission, and you should play around with them
to fit the group’s preferences.
Enemies
Who the Beacons face provide both mechanical and
narrative influences to the mission. You will find details
about each of the factions, and rules for using enemies on
page 77.

Fighting
The core gameplay of LIGHT centers around the Beacons
fighting against the threats to humanity. The Beacons have
a wide arsenal of weapons at their disposal, elemental
powers at their fingers, and they want to use them.
In general, the Beacons are more powerful than any enemy
that they will face. This is especially the case when they
work together. But they can be defeated, slowly worn down
if they run into one fight after another.
Most missions can handle around 3 firefights before the
Beacons start to feel in danger in terms of low Health and
Light. Adding Wells can help extend that (covered in more
detail on page 63), by replenishing their Health and Light.
Mixing up the enemies that the Beacons face is important to
keep the combat feeling fresh. Three different types of
enemies are much more interesting to fight than five of the
same enemy.

Exploration
While LIGHT is primarily focused on combat, the Beacons
cannot fight forever. Not only will their resources be
drained, but their interest in doing one fight after another
may be draining as well.
Missions should provide opportunities for the Beacons to
stop and explore their surroundings. Exploration and
discovery are important parts of a Beacon’s work, as they
will be traveling to some truly incredible places over the
course of their lives.
Encourage exploration by rewarding it. This can be
narrative rewards, such as learning more about the world
or enemies. There might also be more tangible rewards,
such as finding a shortcut that allows them to ambush an
upcoming fight, or gaining further favor with one of the
factions of the Lighthouse.

Wells
As Beacons fight their way through a mission, they will
begin to lose their Health and Light, and may even have
resurrected from a dire situation. The more this happens,
the more the Beacons are to avoid conflict, hesitate when
moving forward with a mission, or avoid conflict at all costs
to protect themselves.
Typically, a mission should include 1 Well for every 3
encounters the Beacons have with the enemy. Though,
particularly dangerous missions might have fewer, or
missions in safer territory may have more.
Wells are moments of respite that the Beacons can seek
out, places of power that allow them to recover for a
moment. Wells can take many shapes. Perhaps a medbay in
a facility, or a pool of radiant Light that the Beacons can use
to stitch up their wounds.
Wells should provide some form of recovery for the
Beacons. The number of Wells and what benefit they
provide is up to the GM, and will help set the tone of the
mission.

• Health or Light recovery
• Removing points of Shade
• Imbuing power, temporarily increasing Attributes
• Opportunity to swap out a weapon

mutated versions of previous foes appearing alongside
them.

/*
At the end of a mission, each Beacon should check to see if
they have fulfilled one of their Beats. If they have done so,
they mark it as completed and choose an Advance. Once an
Advance has been selected, the player should check that
advance off the list, and update their character sheet to
reflect the choice.
Class Advances represent the Beacons becoming more
powerful. Connections to the Light grow stronger, and so
do the Beacons.
Once all of a Beacon’s class Advances have been taken,
they have reached the pinnacle of their power. They may
continue to improve their character through loot and
faction boons, but they no longer select class Advances by
completing Beats.
*/

/*
The Beacons advance their strength through the loot they
collect at the end of missions, and curating their collection
of weapons. While Beacons do not necessarily keep all of
the loot they collect, breaking those guns down so that they
may customize their current weapons at the gunsmith is
part of character advancement.
Loot advancement is an ongoing process, and never ends
for the Beacons. They will always be searching for
opportunities to improve their current weapons, or build up
new weapons to test out in the field.
Not only that, but chasing after legendary weapons can be
an exciting activity for veteran Beacons, and one that the
GM should make more regularly available to the players
after they have built up their arsenal.
*/

/*
While not as tangible as class Advances or loot, the boons
gained from factions are an important part of advancing the
Beacons. They provide an opportunity to create
connections with the factions, while also rewarding
working with them in the form of narrative boons.
Those boons may manifest as bonuses to use in missions,
but also may provide new story or narrative opportunities.
Advancing the story and the Beacons’ connection to the
world, instead of just having the “numbers go up.”
*/


/*
One way to format your mission creation and selection
process is to utilize the “bounty board” approach seen in
other RPGs. A bounty board has a variety of missions
available to the Beacons at once, and the Beacons choose
which one to focus on. These missions usually come from a
variety of factions, and offer a wide range of mission types.

This is a nice way to do things because it allows the players
to choose which missions they are most interested in,
instead of the GM being the sole decider. It’ll also help you
start to see which types of missions the Beacons keep
reaching for, allowing them to better prepare future
sessions.
An added twist to this is to have missions on a “clock”,
meaning that they are only available on the board for so
long. If the Beacons continuously ignore a particular
mission, it could be failed and cascading into larger
problems. That is an excellent opportunity to show
consequences to the Beacon’s choices, and that the world
is alive.
If the Beacons ignore that Corvus assault on Mars for too
long, the planet just might be lost.
