Consequences:
Consequences can come in a variety of different forms,
such as taking damage, being less effective than hoped, or
taking longer to do than expected. The important thing is
that the consequence fits the situation, and doesn’t
completely stop the Beacons from moving forward.

LIGHT is not a game that is meant to be “balanced.” In fact, I
don’t think that balance is something that a game should
strive for. LIGHT is considered the proto-LUMEN game, a
system that is about capturing the power fantasy feeling of
first person shooters. The Beacons are designed to feel
powerful.
But they aren’t invincible. There are many ways to
challenge the players. Overwhelming forces are one. But
you can also have the enemies react in unexpected ways.
Perhaps the Beacons think things are going their way,
when suddenly the Reaver force they are fighting drops a
reflective shield, negating all weapons.


There are no perfect numbers, and I wouldn't advise on
how many enemies to include. Instead, variety will be the
key to both interesting and challenging sessions. Variety in
enemy types, variety in what the Beacons are doing during
a mission.
Most importantly, discuss as a table what kind of challenge
the players are looking for.

/*
Session
How you run a session will depend on what your table
prefers. Typically, the players are presented with their
mission options at the start of the session, and decide
which to pursue. This is also a time for them to connect with
important characters and factions in the world, outside of
combat. Spending time in the Lighthouse before and after
missions will ground the Beacons into this solar system
they are protecting.
During a mission, the players will be going back and forth
between exploring their environment, and fighting back
enemy forces in combat. Give moments of discovery
between fights, instead of throwing the Beacons into one
firefight after another. The system is big, and there is a lot
to explore out there.
