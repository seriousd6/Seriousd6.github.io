/*
In the time of LIGHT, the Sol system finds itself flooded with
invading forces. These newfound enemies of humanity
have come for their own purposes, but all seem like moths
drawn to the flame, to our Light.
The enemies found here can be found all across the
system. They have managed to create footholds on the
various planets and moons we call home, and they seek to
break us apart. The Beacons are stretched thin dealing with
them, and some worry we’re on the brink of a collapse.
Here, we’ll take a look at the major enemy factions in Sol.
These represent the threats that Beacons most commonly
deal with, though there may be more lurking in the
shadows just outside our sight.

• Health: The amount of Harm they take before they are
killed.
• Harm: How much Harm they deal to Beacons, and at
what range.
• Faction Effect: A special effect or action that is unique
to the enemy faction.
• Moves: Narrative actions the enemy may do whenever
they act. These give the GM a sense of how the enemy
typically acts while in a fight, and can be used to make
them feel more dynamic during combat.

Conquerors who have found their way to our doorstep. The
Corvus Dominion is a militaristic alien species who
represent one of the most organized and powerful threats
to the Sol system. Ornate armor, hammered to appear like
feathers, protects the bird-like creatures underneath.
The Corvus society is one of “nests”, with each nest
contributing to the collective “flock.” Nests bear specific
responsibilities for the survival of the species. In addition,
each nest must contribute personnel and technology to the
Dominion’s military forces.
As a result, the Corvus Dominion has a wide variety of
troops to deploy. Their efforts are always coordinated, and
highly effective. Our own military forces are learning to
adapt to the Corvus's movements, but their technology
means we rarely fight on even ground with them.

The Corvus are the most straight-forward fight the
Beacons will ever run up against. As a military force, they
will deploy a variety of different troops to stop the Beacons,
forcing them to change their tactics throughout a mission.
The Corvus’s unique faction effect is called Flock. Flock
effects are based on Corvus units working more effectively
when they are together on the battlefield.
The Corvus are a great choice as the primary antagonists of
a mission, or even campaign. Their numbers are massive,
and they can be found across the system. They have likely
established bases on every planet, and are looking to
continue that expansion.
Because of this, the Corvus work well in every mission
type. Played up as an invading army, the Corvus can be a
consistent threat that the Beacons need to face off against.
To add tension, you may present the Beacons with multiple
fronts to face the Corvus, knowing that fighting on one
battleground means giving up another.
The Corvus are the perfect choice for a constant force for
the Beacons to face off against.

The Surge are an invasive “species” of nanotechnology.
Many believed the Surge to be the results of an experiment
in the Belt gone wrong, but we’ve since learned they are
much more than that.
We classify the Surge as a hivemind, but also a virus. A
massive wave of nanobots that meld together to take a
variety of shapes, the Surge move from system to system to
“integrate” all data they collect, to improve the machine.
This integration process involves observation of a species
or location, and eventually consuming them.
With each planet and species the Surge encounter, they
adapt, learning new skills, strategies, and forms. As such,
prolonged exposure to them is heavily discouraged, as
doing so would allow them to begin to not only learn
countermeasures against us, but to mimic us as well.

The Surge are extremely adaptable, and best suited as an
enemy force that the Beacons don’t have long firefights
against. Instead, the Surge is a force that must be studied,
and literally “shut down”, as opposed to being shot to
death.
The Surge’s unique faction effect is called Adapt. Once an
Attribute has been used to attack a Surge unit, the next
attack must use another Attribute, otherwise it has no
effect.
Missions with the Surge should involve situations where
they have begun to take over and integrate a location.
Intricate nanotechnology weaves itself into the very land
itself as the Surge begins to study and grow.
The Surge are probably the most adaptable force the
Beacons will face against. The example enemies in this
book can and should be changed as the Surge learns more
about the Sol system and the Beacons within. Create
situations where the Surge in one mission feel different
from the Surge in the next, as if they have learned and
literally changed shape.

Devourers of stars, and a force of darkness from the very
edges of our galaxy. Very little is known of the Novae,
though we have managed to piece together some things
through our interactions with the other enemy factions in
Sol. It seems the Novae are a threat to everyone.
The Novae species lays dormant in the dark places
between the stars, sending scouting ships to find their next
meal. Upon arrival in a system, those scouts destabilize
any living species that may try to prevent the Novae from
having their next meal. Once the local populace is dealt
with, the Novae feed, eventually causing the star to go
supernova.
Novae scouts now linger in the Sol system. They are
considered extremely dangerous. They appear to be able to
take control or corrupt others, forcing our enemies to work
together to fight against us. In addition, the Novae appear
to be the first species that is repellent of the powers our
Beacons wield. If the Light won’t kill them, what will?

The Novae are best seen as a supplementary enemy force,
as opposed to the main opposition of a mission or
campaign. One or two of them during a mission will be
enough of a challenge for the Beacons. Their numbers in
the system are small right now, as only the scouting ships
have arrived. Nevertheless, their influence is massive even
with such a small presence.
The Novae’s faction effect is called an Eclipse, but unlike
other factions, each Novae unit has a unique Eclipse effect.
Eclipses make the Novae especially dangerous opponents,
and will force the Beacons to adapt, run, or die.
The Novae have managed to enthrall many of the other
enemy forces, meaning they do not see the Novae as a
threat. Because of this, it is possible for one or two Novae
to appear on any mission. When they do show up, it is an
indicator to the Beacons that something more dangerous is
happening than meets the eye.
The Novae also rarely fight the Beacons on their own. Their
powers are such that they can negate the Light of the
Beacons, which means the enemy forces they’ve enthralled
finally have a fighting chance against the immortal
guardians. Use the Novae to bolster and make the other
enemies more terrifying, while also making the Beacons
question what is really going on.

While most of humanity is content to let the Beacons
handle the threats to the system, some have other plans.
The Ruin are an insidious cult of humanity, spreading from
one settlement to the next. They believe that the power to
defend our system should be in everyone’s hands. And that
power is magic.
Exposure to an unknown relic in the Belt corrupted and
created the first Ruined. It granted the individual access to
magic, through occult practices and rituals. Their desire for
power grew, and so the corruption of the Ruin spread. Now
the cult is everywhere, lurking in shadows, the ruinous
powers fueling them.
As a person uses more of the Ruin’s magic, they themselves
become more powerful, but at the cost of their humanity.
Powerful Ruined are recognizable by their monstrous
appearance. Their bodies being calcified with a crystalline
shell, and their magics becoming more brazen and
dangerous. Some are even rumored to be able to bring
back the dead…


The Ruin represents both a human threat, and something
worse. Their “magic” is largely not understood by those
outside of the cult. Many of them also believe that what
they are doing is for the best, and that they are creating
power to defend humanity.
The Ruin’s faction effect is called Chain. Chain allows
higher ranking Ruin units to sacrifice lower units in their
place whenever they would take Harm. The order of
ranking is Zealot, Acolyte, Horror, Priest. Zealots cannot
benefit from Chain as they are the lowest member of the
cult.
As a result, they make an excellent foil for the Beacons.
Missions and campaigns with the Ruin allow the Beacons to
grapple with the unknown occult forces of the universe,
while also grappling with the morality of a people wanting
to defend themselves, even if it costs their humanity.
The Ruin are an opportunity to weave an insidious poison
throughout a campaign. If unchecked, Ruined individuals
become more powerful as they tap further into their source
of power. Settlements or even entire planets may turn
against humanity or the Beacons as the cult’s power rises
over time. The Ruin are the perfect ticking clock in your
game.

The Reavers, also known as the Dread Fleet, are a group of
piratical raiders who specialize in hit-and-run tactics. Their
armada of fast moving ships sails in the wake of the Corvus
Dominion; where the Corvus go to conquer, the Dread Fleet
seeks to plunder.
This parasitic relationship with the Corvus puts them at
odds, but the Reavers are too practiced in infiltration,
stealth, and trickery to ever be caught and destroyed. With
the arrival of the Corvus Dominion in the Sol system, the
Reavers soon followed.
Here they have found a veritable playground of locations to
plunder. Reaver forces wear lightweight armor, more
equipped for infiltration and sabotage than protection.
When they hit a location, they hit it hard and fast, and are
gone before counter forces are able to be deployed.
With the Corvus establishing themselves in the system, the
Dread Fleet seek a similar sort of stability. And they are
willing to take everything they need to make that happen.

The Reavers serve as an opportunity to force the Beacons
into quick action. Missions and campaigns featuring the
Reavers are centered around trying to predict and fend off
raids, while also trying to dismantle any progress the Fleet
has made in establishing a foothold in the system.
The Reaver’s faction effect is called Fleet. Each time a
Reaver unit dies, if there is another Reaver Close to them,
that unit may immediately act.
Facing off against the Reavers should almost never be a fair
fight, and rarely on the Beacon’s terms. The Dread Fleet is
highly mobile, and does not prefer standard warfare
because they aren’t equipped to handle it. Ambushes and
abusing the vulnerabilities of the Beacons are the
specialties of the Reavers.
As such, missions and campaigns with the Reavers can
feature opportunities for the Beacon’s home, and the
people they care about, to be vulnerable and under siege.
Settlements and people the Beacons grow close to are
targets of Reaver raids, and are a perfect opportunity to
give the Beacons a boost in motivation to go out on their
next mission.
