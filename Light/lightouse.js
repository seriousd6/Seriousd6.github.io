/*
There is only one place the Beacons call home, the hub of
all their activity: the Lighthouse.
While humanity has spread itself across many planets and
moons, Earth will always be our home. Housing the
sharpest minds and bleeding edge technology, no other
place in the system is quite like Earth.
What sets it apart from everywhere else is the Lighthouse,
the base of operations for the Beacons. A bustling city, it is
where Beacons return between missions to rest up, be
briefed on future work, and show off their latest loot.
All sorts of people call the Lighthouse home, not just the
Beacons. These people help the immortal guardians best
do their job. Vulcan and the other gunsmiths create
armaments, while the many factions of Earth provide
missions
*/


/*
Beacons represent a powerful side of humanity, but their
numbers are small. What keeps the human collective alive
and running is the work of the many factions throughout
the Sol system. Each faction has its own responsibilities
and agendas, and sometimes they call upon the Beacons
for assistance.
The Beacons of the Lighthouse are not ruled by a single
entity. Instead, they choose work to pursue from various
factions across the Sol system. Many of those factions have
a representative at the Lighthouse to directly commission
Beacons, while others prefer to stay at their respective
planet or moon, waiting for the Beacons to come to them.
In LIGHT, factions are an opportunity to add flavor to the
missions that the Beacons go on. While the Missions (page
54) section provides the rules for creating missions, the GM
may also decide to attach the mission to a particular
faction.
A faction has two components: bounties and boons.
*/

/*
Bounties
Bounties are additional tasks that Beacons can attempt to
accomplish while out on a mission. These bounties
represent the role the faction serves for humanity. As such,
each faction has unique bounties.
Bounties are always optional, and might not be included in
every mission. The GM may decide to choose one, or ask
the Beacons to choose one, as a means of adding an extra
goal for the Beacons to strive for on an already dangerous
mission.

Defining Bounties
There are no mechanical definitions to bounties. They
require a narrative interpretation between the players and
the GM. For example, the Warden bounty “Gather critical
military intel” doesn’t define what counts as intel, or would
be considered critical.
Work together as a group during the mission to find ways to
interpret and incorporate a bounty. Discuss what you think
would need to happen for a bounty to be considered
complete. Check in during the mission to confirm when a
bounty has been completed.

Tracking & Making Bounties
Once a bounty has been completed, the GM should cross it
off the list, as the faction no longer requires that sort of
work for the time being. If all of the bounties of a faction
have been crossed off, they may be repeated, as the
faction’s work is never complete. As a token of gratitude,
the Beacons are given a customized emblem or piece of
clothing from the faction. Describe what it looks like when
this happens.
As an alternative, the group may decide to create new
bounties. Work together to create interesting bounties that
are in the spirit of the faction’s goals. Perhaps previous
missions have revealed that the faction needs new pursuits
after learning about the threats to the system. What will
they do with the information and work the Beacons have
already done?
*/

/*
Boons:
Bounties aren’t just an opportunity to create new
challenges for missions. The factions recognize the efforts
of the Beacons, and reward completion of bounties with
boons.
When a bounty is completed, and the Beacons return to the
faction, they receive a boon. The GM may select an
appropriate boon, or may allow the Beacons to choose their
own reward.

Similar to bounties, boons don’t have a strict definition.
Instead, they require some narrative interpretation from
the table. Boons are meant to provide just that, a small
benefit to the Beacons that they may use sometime in the
future. Work together as a table to decide how and when a
boon manifests for the Beacons.
For example, the Warden boon “Highly destructive
ordinance for a future mission” could be interpreted as a
powerful airstrike, or a collection of explosives the
Beacons carry with them on the mission.

*/

/*
The Wardens, the Veil, and the Rogues. These are three of
the most influential factions in the Lighthouse. Let’s take a
look at each one of these factions and their bounties and
boons.
No doubt the Beacons will discover more as they explore
the city, and the Sol system. Each planet has its own power
structure in place, and there are factions who vie for the
attention of the Beacons at all times.
*/


/*
The Wardens serve two roles. First, and foremost, they are
the predominant defense force on Earth. The Beacons may
hold the Lighthouse, but the Wardens have soldiers
covering the rest of the planet. Most planets in the Sol
system operate with their own protection services, but all
recognize the importance of the Wardens.
This is essential because of their second role. Beacons are
independent guardians, and sometimes they need
guidance. The Wardens act as one of the primary
coordinators of Beacon operations across the system. Not
every Beacon mission is coordinated by the Wardens, but
some of the most important ones are crafted at the war
table at the top of the Lighthouse.

Bounties:
• Take out the enemy forces by ambush
• Leave nobody alive
• Gather critical military intel
• Eliminate a VIP
• Kill with a specific weapon or Attribute
• Defend a location under siege
• Scout out an opportunity for a future mission
• Survive a mission with no deaths

Boons:
• Upgrade existing weaponry with a new Tag
• Increased favor with Vulcan
• Robotic frame soldier support for a future mission
• Emergency evac for a future mission
• Detailed intel report for a future mission
• Highly destructive ordinance for a future mission
• Medical kits for future missions
• Warden insignia, and associated authority

*/

/*
The Veil is a system-spanning faction whose primary
functions are intelligence gathering, spy and infiltration
work, and generally monitoring any notable threats. Who
exactly gets that information is up to the Veil, and
oftentimes other factions will receive a stream of data
without a word of explanation.
Veil operatives tend to keep their identities hidden. As a
result, when the organization reaches out to Beacons, it is
done so because they have found a threat dangerous
enough to risk Veil exposure. In exchange, Beacons get
access to some of the Veil’s incredible network and
archives of information.

Bounties:
• Assess the danger of a possible threat
• “Collect” data from another faction’s archives
• Plant a tracking device on a crucial VIP
• Leave a corrupting file in enemy systems
• Bring in a VIP for questioning
• Eliminate a traitor within our ranks
• Track down rumors of a place of power
• Unveil a means of granting new Light powers

Boons:
• Covert drop off for missions
• A lead on a place of power for Beacons
• Supply cache left at a key location
• Acquisition of an illegal item 
• Meeting with a highly sought out VIP
• Forbidden insight on the Dark
• Access to the hidden library
• A temporary Light renewing power source

/*
Sometimes the Wardens and Veil are too busy thinking
about the whole system, they forget about the city under
their feet. The Rogues are a collective who use
“alternative” means of looking out for themselves and
others. Because Rogues come from all walks of life, they
have incredible connections, and those contacts can be of
great benefit to a Beacon willing to bend the rules a little.
Rogue work is rarely legal, but the payoff can be big if you
pull it off. Beyond the legality though, the Rogues live in a
morally gray space, and it takes a certain kind of Beacon to
stomach the work at times. Despite their ragtag
appearance, the Rogues have built up a network across the
system, and they have work waiting on every planet and
moon.

Bounties:
• Smuggle some contraband to a location
• Collect a relic of the Dark, for research...
• Prevent the Veil from discovering a spy
• Check on a safe house that’s gone quiet
• Steal a prototype from the armory
• Acquire some Era of Dawn tech
• Bring back some enemies, alive
• Test out some experimental tech in the field

Boons:
• Era of Dawn weapon tech modification
• A sizable amount of currency, life changing
• A favor, to be called on at any time
• Get-out-of-jail-free card
• A lead on a place of power for the Dark
• Develop a new weapon tag, custom made
• Access to Rogue safe houses in the system
• A shard of pure Dark
