        "Scabbard of Sharpening - A blade drawn from this metal scabbard is magically honed to razor sharpness, doing +1 extra damage when it strikes an opponent. The first time you miss, however, the enchantment wears off as the blade is dulled by your opponent's shield or armor or it hits the stone floor or whatever. (To get the bonus again, you have to sheathe and draw it again. The damage bonus does not stack with multiple drawings, it can only be +1, and only on one weapon at a time.) Every time the blade is sheathed or drawn, there's the distinct, and rather loud, sound of metal being sharpened.", "Snakeskin Sheath (Requires attunement) - This sheath is made of python skin. If you draw your sword and throw the sheath on the ground, it functions as per the magic item Staff of the Python.", "Mace Miter (Requires attunement) - This ornately decorated cone-shaped hat was once worn by a long-dead bishop. It still makes a fine head covering, if you want to wear it that way. But even better, you can turn it upside down, lash it to your belt, and carry your mace around in it. Whether used as a hat or a mace holder, the miter functions as a Holy Symbol +1.", "Flamesheath - This 'sheath' is not made of leather or metal, but flame! Well, sort of. It's just a permanent illusion cast on a normal leather sheath. But it looks pretty bad-ass. A weapon drawn from this sheath does an extra 1D4 fire damage the first time it's used after being drawn; hit or miss, the flames die out until it's resheathed and drawn again. The sheath itself can be used as a light source, functioning as the Light cantrip (but looking more like a torch). To hold the scabbard aloft, you'll have to have your weapon sheathed. Note it can't be turned on or off; the only way to hide the flames is to stick the sheath into a sack or other opaque object.", "Assassin's Sheath - This small leather sheath would appear to hold nothing larger than a tiny folding knife, but any weapon up to a great sword can be sheathed in it. The size of the weapon is revealed only when it is drawn from the scabbard, whether by the wearer or a wary guard. Unlike most scabbards, to draw a weapon from this one requires the Use an Object action. (The weapon's actual size can be revealed by Truesight.)", "Living Quiver (Requires attunement) - Prized among Elves, Rangers, and Druids, this quiver is not made but grown, of meticulously cultivated living plants. It requires daily watering and must have a long rest in sunshine at least once a week, or it withers and dies. Once bonded with the quiver, it responds to your thought. Just reach a hand back and it will be filled with the arrow, javelin, or dart you desired. After every long rest in the sunshine, the quiver 'grows' 1D4 arrows (or 1D8 darts or one javelin), up to a maximum of 20 arrows, 40 darts, or 5 javelins. They look roughly made of primitive materials, almost like something a child would make, but they fly true and are considered magical for the purposes of enemy immunity or resistance. Alas, these arrows (or darts or javelins) always break on impact, and therefore can't be recovered at the end of the battle as other expended ammunition can be.", "Bloodthirsty Scabbard (Requires attunement) - If a blood-covered blade is sheathed in this blood-red scabbard, the creature attuned to it regains 2D6 hit points, up to a maximum of however much damage the blade did to the creature it drew blood from. (Not a construct or undead). Works once per long rest.", "Sorcerer's Scabbard - This scabbard is preferred by magic-users who don't want to be targeted in the first round. It's not a scabbard at all, but a waterproof case large enough to house one staff, two wands, or four scrolls. (Only the top-most item can be accessed; you have to remove it to get to the one below.) The case's 'cap' is the hilt of a gnarly looking sword. Any item stored in the case is protected from Detect Magic or Truesight (though a wise creature with Truesight will know something's awry by the fact that they can't see through it).", "Jawbreaker Pouch - This magic pouch contains six brightly colored, perfectly round bullets... great ammunition for slings. If for some reason you were to put one of these bullets into your mouth, you would discover it's a Goodberry as per the spell. Any expended stone, either fired or consumed, regrows in 24 hours.", "Sheath of Teeth - This rather cumbersome scabbard appears to be made out of ivory. No, wait. Oh man, those are teeth. Some barbarian warlord ordered the teeth of his enemies ripped out of their mouths and made into a scabbard for his great sword. The teeth chatter in terror whenever an invisible or ethereal creature is within line of sight. Every time a blade is drawn or sheathed, the teeth gnash in agony. Not great for stealth but it's so. Damn. Metal.", "Quiver of Love - A masterwork or better arrow kept in this small six shaft sleeve for at least a day will do no damage if drawn and fired. Instead the target will be affected by raising its reaction attitude by two steps. Hostile would be indifferent. Unfriendly would become friendly. Indifferent would become helpful.", "Wary Scabbard - This scabbard can sense when a fight is about to happen, and will therefore assist when you draw your sword. You get advantage on initiative rolls.", "Bard's Baldric - This deceptively flashy sash can hold an enormous number of weapons and musical instruments. Every hour, one weapon or instrument hung on the Bard's Baldric turns into an embroidered 'patch' that can be removed as if drawing the weapon or musical instrument forth. Twelve daggers, two rapiers, a crossbow, three cantrip shooter pistols, four wands, two staves, two lutes, a flute, a flugelhorn, a bassoon, a lyre, a set of five dwarvish pan-drums, nine chimes, plus 29 full, three partial, and eight empty bottles of elvish wine were reputed to have been stored on the sash at the same time. The embroidery patches are allowed to overlap without affecting their accessibility as long as the wearer stays aware of what is where. Apparently elvish wine bottles can be used as musical instruments, full or empty.", "Heavy Hangers - These braces seem to weigh far too much at 10 pounds empty, but whatever weapons are carried by the two loops on the wearers back will weigh up to 20 pounds less each.", "Launching Scabbard (Requires attunement) - When the command word is spoken, the weapon stored in the scabbard is launched forward at high speed, as per the Catapult spell. The wearer can attempt a DC 20 DEX or sleight of hand check to catch the weapon. If they succeed, then they have drawn the weapon as a free action. If they fail, the weapon goes flying off in a straight line (again, as per the Catapult spell).", "Wand Sheath of Charging - Fits any wand and has its own set of 50 charges. When you place a wand in it, the next use will use the sheath's charges instead of the wand's.", "Scab-Bard - This metal scabbard is made for a rapier. Tiny holes drilled at strategic locations along its length allow it to be used, in a pinch, as a flute.", "Sheath of Shadow - The blade drawn from this scabbard will start out looking like a dim shadowy illusion, and for 2d6 rounds will remain indistinct, completely silent, and gain the ghost touch property. Not only is the sword silent and hidden, but by will of wanting stealth, but a victim so wounded can make no sound, and if killed while the blade is a shadow, the victim's body is shifted to the plane of Shadow. Blood drawn fades as shadow-like smoke.", "Scabbard of Souls - This scabbard contains the souls of enemies slain by the sword it holds. The screams of the entrapped souls howl in terror whenever sheathing or unsheathing your sword from this scabbard. The sword kept in this scabbard does an additional +1 necrotic damage, and the soul of any creature killed by the sword is trapped in the scabbard and the creature cannot be resurrected as long as the scabbard is intact.", "Defender's Scabbard - This heavy metal scabbard for a one handed blade magically unfolds into a shield when no weapon rests inside it. You can equip the scabbard as a shield in the same action you draw the weapon from it. When a weapon is inserted, it returns to being a compact scabbard.", "Flash of Steel - You may draw the blade sheathed within this scabbard as a Reaction. When you do so, a Physical Attack against you is Deflected and misses you, should you best the Attacker in a Contested Sleight of Hand (Dexterity) Check, so long as you are Proficient in the Skill. If you win the Contested Check, you may then Move up to 5 Feet away from the direction of the Attack (either straight or diagonally), this Movement does not Provoke Opportunity Attacks. You may perform this Reaction a number of times a day Equal to your Dexterity Modifier.", "Scabbard of Disarming - Any length of steel placed into this scabbard is permanently destroyed. Half-sheathing your sword will leave you with half of a sword. Fully sheathing will leave you with just the hilt. There is no way to recover a blade lost via this method.", "Immovable Scabbard - A scabbard that is also an immovable rod.", "Grung hide sheath/quiver - Multicolored with vibrant reds, blues, and yellows, and smooth to the touch. Any weapon/ammunition stored in it gain one use of paralytic poison. Target must make a DC 11 Con save or be paralyzed for 1d4-1 turns, they may attempt this save at the beginning of any remaining turns while this effect is active.", "Sheath of Sheathing - This sheath functions as a bag of holding, but for any sword that would fit in it. There is always a sword handle poking out of it which you grab to pull out a sword, that you think of, that you have already placed inside of it. The handle disappears when no swords are being held or you are about to sheath one. You can decide which sword’s handle is poking out, but it has to be one that is already inside. The Sheath of Sheathing can hold up to 100 swords. Such as a Bag of Holding, the Sheath does not require attunement and if you try to put it in another extra dimensional space which functions similar, both are destroyed.", "Sword Poacher - This black scabbard is seemingly unremarkable, with a plain looking sword hilt placed in its top. As an action you can draw the sword hilt and force a target within 60 ft you can see who has a melee weapon to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the weapon is transported in to your hand and the hilt will returns to the scabbard. If the target isn’t holding their weapon, they make the save with disadvantage. If you target a weapon that isn’t being worn, carried or held, there is no saving throw and the weapon is transported to your hand. You can use this feature 3 times, regaining all uses at dawn. If you lose the hilt, you must replace it with a different hilt by it in to the scabbard and leaving it there for 24 hours.",
        "Elemental Syphon (Only works on one weapon type, determined by DM) - This brown scabbard has a large clear gem embedded in to its surface, with brass detailing. When you take acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can spend a charge and use your reaction to halve the amount taken. To do so, you must be holding the scabbard in your hand. The scabbard stores the energy, causing the gem to flow the corresponding colour and glow with 5 ft of dim light. The scabbard stores the energy for 1 hour, or until you use this feature again. The next time you draw a weapon from the scabbard, it is charged with elemental energy for 1 minute and deals an additional 1d6 damage (of the stored type) on a hit. This scabbard has 4 charges, and regains 1d4 daily at dawn.", "Paytowin (Only works for one weapon type, determined by DM) - This ornately carver and decorated golden scabbard has silver and platinum details. The whole at the top of it where you would place a sword is too small to fit a normal sword, instead roughly the right size to fit a standard coin. (If there are coins of various shapes and sizes in your setting, you can decide which type of coin fits.) You can feed coins in to the scabbard through the slot, which magically seem to disappear as there is not enough space to fit them in to the scabbard otherwise. After the coins have been placed inside, and the sword is left along for 1 hour, a magical sword made of the matching precious metals appears inside of it. The sword can be removed and placed back in to the scabbard, but no other sword can be. The sword is either +1 (300 gp), +2 (900 gp) or +3 (2700 gp). The sword remains until broken or you create a new one from the scabbard.", "Dusks Breath (Fits regular daggers) - This dark black dagger sheath has a small stone decoration of a woman’s mouth with a finger to it, like it is hushing. When you draw a dagger from the sheath, an area of silence (as if you had cast the spell) appears in a 10ft radius centered on you (but not moving with you). The area remains until the end of your next turn. Once used, this feature can’t be used again for 1 minute.", "Forge Breath (Fits regular long swords) - This iron scabbard is engraved with dwarven runes, with a large central giant “ild” rune at the top that glows like warm coals. When a non-magical metal sword is placed in to scabbard, the ild rune flares up. If the sword is left in the scabbard for 1 minute it heats up, remaining heated for 1 minute after removed. A heated blade deals an additional 1d8 fire damage on a hit.", "Multiblade (Works on any weapon that would reasonably fit in to it) - This scabbard has a small rotating dial with five gemstones embedded in to it, and another gem stone above the dial. As an action you can place a weapon in to the scabbard and speak its command word to bond it with the scabbard, causing a gemstone to light up. When the dial is rotated sword magically disappears in to an extradimensional space. When rotated so it’s correspond gem is selected, that weapon’s hilt reappears so that you can draw it from the scabbard. You can store up to five weapons in the scabbard at a time.", "Hidden Edge (Works on any weapon that would reasonably fit in to it) - This small sheath always weighs 1 lb, and is an unremarkable brown leather. The inside of the sheath is magically enlarged, so when a weapon is placed in to the sheath it fits even though it doesn’t look like it normally would. Additionally, when a weapon is placed in the sheath both the hilt and the sheath turn invisible until the weapon is drawn from the sheath again.", "Daggerstorm (Fits any normal sized dagger) - This fairly normal looking sheath has three holes, two at the back and one at the front on top of the others. The sheath has 3 charges. When a dagger is placed in to the top hole, nothing magical happens. When placed in to the left hole, you cast conjure volley and when placed in to the right hole, you cast blade barrier. Neither spell requires components or concentration, but end early if the dagger is removed, and spends a charge when used. If you place a dagger in to the left and right hole at the same time, the sheath explodes and is destroyed, throwing shrapnel around. Each forcing creature in a 30ft radius must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 piercing damage on a failure or half as much on a success. You automatically fail this saving throw if the sheath is attached to you. The sheath regains 1d3 charges daily at dawn.", "Mirrorune (Works for one weapon type, determined by the DM; requires attunement) This scabbard is white, with reflective metal decorations and the symbol of three crossing arms gripping each other on the wrist. As a bonus action when you draw your weapon from this scabbard, you can speak its command word to cast mirror image on yourself. The spell ends early if you return the weapon to the scabbard. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can cause one of your duplicates to attack with you, dealing an additional 1d8 psychic damage. You can do this a number of times per turn equal to the number of duplicates you have. When you’ve used this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.", "Spellscribed (Works for one weapon type, determined by the DM; requires attunement) - This scabbard is carved with intricate arcane tunes which shimmer and glow with magical energy. The magic of this scabbard only works while it is on your person, and a non-magical weapon is placed inside of it. When you successfully counter or dispel a spell, the scabbard captures it and burns runes and symbols on to the weapon inside of it. A creature holding the weapon can cast the spell using their own spell slots and consuming the sword in the process. If the spell requires material components, the destruction of the sword replaces them. A wizard can copy the spell in to their spell book if they use the sword as a guide.", "Returning Quiver Arrows and ranged weapons fired/thrown are magnetized back to the quiver (either just instantly returning, or travelling in a straight line back to the wearer. If they travel, they can damage anything in their path, are stopped by solid objects, and must be caught or they might harm the wearer.)", "Sentient Quiver (Requires attunement) - The quiver binds to the consciousness of the wearer.

During this time, damage rolls with the weapon roll no dice, instead the weapon deals 1 point of damage.", "Divining Sheath - Once per day, when a weapon is drawn from this sheath, the weapon may be used as a focus to cast the spell locate object without expending a spell slot. The tip of the hilt (or tip of the blade) points the direction toward the target object.", "Duplication Sheath -Once a weapon is placed into this sheath, duplicates of the weapon may be drawn from the sheath at any time. These duplicate weapons do not have any magical properties and disappear 1 minute after being drawn from the sheath.", "Poisoning Sheath - The edges of this sheath are coated in a magically regenerating poison. Any weapon that fits into the sheath and is then drawn deals 1d10 poison damage on the next hit. The target must suceed upon a DC 15 Con save or be poisoned for a minute. This effect can be used up to 3 times a day.", "Grinny, the Mimic Sheath (Wondrous Item, uncommon, requires attunement) - Grinny is a tame mimic created in an age long past by a powerful sorcerer as a gift for a warrior companion. See details here. (Based from, and meant to be paired with, Toothy the Trusty Mimic.", "Scabbard of Animation - A magical artifact of unknown origin. Whatever weapon (although a sword usually fits best) is placed into it is immediately bestowed sentience.", "Dragonscale Sheath (Requires attunement) - A blade drawn from this form-fitting sheath deals +1 damage to draconic creatures, and confers many powers. See details here.", "Thunder - You may draw the blade within this scabbard as a Bonus Action, dealing 1d4 Thunder Damage to the first Target within 15ft of you that you point your Blade at. The Target must succeed a DC 14 Constitution Save, or be Deafened until the End of Your Next Turn. The First Attack you make with the Blade after Drawing it gains +1 Lightning Damage. You may use this Bonus Action a number of times per day equal to twice your Constitution Modifier.", "Whetstone Sheath - Only usable once on short/long rest, can not be applied to magical items. Adamantine gives the ability to bypass damage reduction or resistance for 1d4 swings of that slashing or piercing weapon; Mithral gives silvered and a plus one for 2d4 attacks with that slashing or piercing weapon.", "Dryad Tears - This sack was once soaked in Dryad Tears. Any wooden melee weapon stored in it can add 1D4 debuff for one round, effective for 1d6 attacks.", "Phoenix Quiver - A non-magical, unfletched arrow or quarrel placed into this quiver will grow fletches that burst into flames on impact, causing 1D6 fire damage in a 5-foot radius from the target. The arrow or quarrel is consumed by the flames.", "Shielding Sheath - This sword sheath can give you a bonus +2 to your ac as a reaction. It can be used as a club for use as two weapon fighting.", "Sheath of Speed - As a draw action, you may make a melee attack with the sword in this sheath. The target may use a reaction to take a five foot step away from the opponent to avoid this attack. Usable once per short rest.", "Faithful Scabbard - (Requires attunement) This scabbard was made for a warrior who liked to draw his sword and dramatically toss away his scabbard... but also wanted to get the scabbard back at the end of the battle. Once tossed aside, the scabbard will slowly but relentless wriggle and writhe on the ground, snake-like, until it returns to the creature attuned to it. Could backfire if you're attempting to hide after a losing battle.", "Sheath of Avarice - A gilded sheath of some kind, and Detect Magic would discover Transmutation. Any weapon put in becomes coated in gold but (if you opt for it to be cursed), loses any magical properties unless it is an artifact or a higher rarity (probably Rare or higher), or it is made out of Mithral or Adamantine. If you cast Remove Curse on the sheath and put a weapon gilded by it inside, it will turn back to normal. If the weapon is non-magical, treat as 10 times the price (minimum of 5 Gold Pieces).", "Scabbard of Dispense - This scabbard can hold any appropriate weapon, but up 10 of them, as it is longer on the inside than the outside (Bag of Holding rules for piercing it and throwing it inside another). You may draw from it as part of the attack action (even if the weapon is thrown) if you are the person directly holding it. Otherwise, it's an action. The weapons come out in the order you put them in, so the last weapon put in comes out first, and so on. The hilt of the last weapon is shown outside of it. It is an action to stow weapons in it, which happens when you move an appropriate weapon nearby it (which then causes the top weapon's hilt to disappear, unless at max).", "Attachable Quiver (or Case) - This 'quiver' appears as a normal quiver, except for some hooks it has at the end. You may attach this to object, items, and similar, where the hooks magically attach themselves to the object or item (action). The quiver, however, also adjusts its size in regards to what its attaching to. The amount of arrows the quiver can carry stay the same regardless, however. It may be attached to the base of a weapon that requires ammo (if it makes sense to fit), whereupon it will automatically dispense the next ammo you need when you draw it (and gives the exact type, in the case of magic arrows or different types of ammo stored inside). Variants of this may actually assist in firing, in which case, if the weapon has the reload or loading property, it may be done as a free action.", "Sheath of Rust - This sheath looks like a normal sheath, but is actually host to the slime of a grey ooze inside it (or is made out of rust monster parts, has an actual grey ooze inside, however you want to flavor it). Whenever a nonmagical ferrous metal weapon is put it, it corrodes it. every day at dawn, if a weapon is inside the sheath, it takes a permanent -1 to damage rolls. This is accumulative, and once it reaches -5, all of the weapon is eaten away except the hilt. Additionally (if the weapon has grey ooze slime coated inside, or has an actual grey ooze inside), if it eats 2 weapons like this, it may create a new grey ooze, which comes out of the sheath and forms outside the sheath. This Grey Ooze may follow the sheath around so long as it has reason to (ie: metal to eat). Only one Grey Ooze may be born like this. This weapon isn't necessarily magic, but if it is enchanted, it gives off Abjuration Magic (which protects the sheath from it's own damaging conditions).", "Quiver of Repair - This quiver repairs arrows and ammo inside, and even houses additional strings for bows or crossbows. If you put any pieces of arrows or bolts inside, (if the parts correspond) after a long rest it will connect them together. Additionally, it has a pouch which carries 2 bow or crossbow strings. If you take this out, and lay it on top of the bow (the bow must be next to the quiver), the magic from the quiver will transfer over to the string, which will magically attach itself to the bow or crossbow over the course of a rest. Every 5 days, the quiver forms another string. The Quiver does not restore magical properties to any repaired arrows or bolts, however. The Quiver itself will repair any harm it takes over the course of a rest, so long as it doesn't 'completely destroy it' (i.e., minor damage it doesn't, if the quiver was cut in half however, you'd need to get both parts so it can repair itself).", "Trickster's Sheath - When a one-handed Bladed Weapon is placed within the Sheath, it changes shape to replicate it, becoming a slightly larger copy. It can be held in your Offhand and easily be mistaken for an exact copy of the bladed weapon, while having none of the stats. This Sheath can stick to a belt as though it were looped, to allow for easy drawing as a faux-offhand weapon.", "Scabbard of the Divine Messenger - When you place a blade of non-prime material origin in the scabbard you can send once a day a message to its creator (like the raven queen, a fire giant, celestial, fiend or another powerful being who made your weapon).",
