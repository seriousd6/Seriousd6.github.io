Its displeasure rumbles through the region and deep, rolling black smoke and chunks of fire explode from its head. The locals are panicked and there is no telling what they will do.", "Two tribes of Jungle Giants, at peace after centuries of conflict, have built a “peace bridge” spanning a huge canyon, and keep sentinels there to ensure the mutual trust between them. A cruising Roc, nearby, was the target of sport and thrown spears from the guards, as a laugh. The creature, enraged, destroyed the bridge and now both sides are blaming one another as war threatens to plunge the region into havoc again.", "A sinkhole opens before the party, suddenly and with much noise. A lone Umber Hulk, wounded and blind, has inadvertently tunneled its way to the surface. It is hurt and angry.", "A flock of Jungle Stirge (whose venom can paralyze their victims) descends on the party each day, every day, until every character has been fed upon or more than half the swarm is destroyed.", "A sudden appearance of a group of Coatl startles the party.

If they press on, the Druid will oppose them, non-violently as long as they can, but with violence if all else fails. The party will meet many corrupted aberrations inside the zone.", "Shambling Mounds have been created all over the region, after a massive arcane storm pelted the area with lightning.

This is only the start of the vanishings.", "An ancient assassin vine, beyond cunning (INT 22 due to a Ring of Intellect taken from a victim centuries ago), wants power more than blood and will attempt to steal from the party while they rest in the region. This will occur every day until its caught or until its stolen at least 1 item from every character.", "The party stumbles across a patch of Shriekers, which alerts the local Minoi (Tinker Gnomes) that more victims have fallen into their trap. The clan will rush out and aggressively try and barber, launder, and tattoo the characters. If the party resists, the Gnomes will grow angry and demand that the characters submit to the “holy process of Continuation”. If the party relents, they will be cleaned, scrubbed, shaved and trimmed and then tattooed with tiny cuneiform-type script that is part of the same record of history that the Gnomes themselves are covered with.

Its roots are exposed and vulnerable and it will lash out ineffectively at anything the party tries, though it has been able to snag some animals here and there. It will bargain for its life by vomiting out treasure from past victims. If the party is stupid enough to set it upright again, it will immediately attack them.", "3 tribes of locals recognize the party from their legends and want to honor them with food, gifts, and other rare goods. The party must choose to sacrifice a group of locals in exchange, however, as part of the contract between mortals and gods. To refuse will bring instant condemnation and perhaps violence.", "The song of an artefact can be heard singing from the depths of an overhung cave. The lament it sings is achingly beautiful and might move some to tears. The item wants nothing more than to renounce its purpose and be destroyed, but its powers are formidable and will be hard to resist using, especially in such a dangerous region.", "The Tarrasque sleeps at the bottom of a massive ravine, covered with vines and vegetation, it has been forgotten by the world, until one day it stirs, wakening slowly.

The conflict is savage and innocent bystanders often caught in the violence. A troop of Awakened chimpanzees are behind the war - part of a larger, long-built plot.", "The Wyvern mating season has begun.

Upon dusk the floor starts to writhe and wriggle, and millions upon millions of carnivorous insects buzz through the lower sections of the jungle until dawn.", "Frogs are a nuisance, everyone in the jungle knows that, but there are certain species that are worse than others.

Hunt them down before you sleep, or else..", "Pygmy headhunters are about, and they prefer theirs shrunken and beaded on a string. They are near invisible, even after they strike. If you feel an itch, check for darts, because the next time you take a rest or stop moving for a while you will be paralyzed and about to be one head short.", "Wickedness is in the air, something bad is buried nearby, which affects a section of jungle downstream from it. The flora breathes the wickedness and it can be sensed even by those without magical aptitude. Magic in this area has a strange way of backfiring, and Shadows lurk about.", "A fungus growth has taken over more than its share locally, and it's spores are so dense they cause a fog-like phenomenon. While most of the fauna is suffering, some creatures thrive, among which a mating pair of giant blind praying mantis. Their tremorsense and coordinated ambush in the fog make for one deadly scythed spectacle of fear and confusion.", "There is a hidden place in the jungle, nested between two within a mountainous zone. It is said to be one of the cleanest places on earth, and the sheer presence there will clean corruption and other vile influences, even curses. The place is beautiful, and covered with more than 300 species of orchids growing from every inch of surface they can grip on. A small rock pond collects the water dripping off the walls, and it is said to hold a serene spirit.", "Don't step on that flail snail by accident, or do, see if it cares (it does).", "A trail of petrified flora and fauna can be encountered. Following to one of the ends will reveal two basilisks engrossed in a mating ritual. This staring contest is a dominance test, and when undisturbed can take up to a month.

If disturbed they become intensely violent and will murder and eat whatever disturbed them before restarting their match.", "Sunbears are magical creatures and revered by natives. Their presence are good omens, speaking of productive jungles and good weather. One of them has been harmed and is wounded, causing a trail of ill fortune, horrible rain storms, decay, and dying. It is fleeing but still being hunted.", "A swarm of Coatl have appeared in the sky - hundreds of them, and with them comes a strange weather phenomenon - the skies are filled with rainbows, too many to count. During the next 7 days a strange fervor will overcome all the locals - natives and wildlife alike. This phenomenon will repeat in 1 year and then never again.", "A bloom of Myconid are on the move, picking up other blooms as they travel, until they number close to 100. They have a goal - to move to an abandoned cavern near some ruins and choose their new leader. They will spawn new blooms as they travel, if they can.", "Something is stirring up the local insect population. A hivemaster Druid perhaps, or some awakened God. Swarms of biting, stinging insects, so numerous they seem without end, are plaguing the local population - natives and wildlife alike. Those bitten suffer greatly and most die.", "A very old, very cunning tiger is stalking the party. It will only attack when advantageous and it will choose one PC as their victim - attempting to drag them away when alone. The tiger is cursed, and can speak if it feels the need, but generally won’t. The curse manifests as a compulsion to devour humanoids, despite the fact that the tiger once was one. It feels extreme guilt.", "A swarm of Quippers have gathered in a local lake/pond/marsh to elect the new King of the Tooth - a boisterous and baudy celebration of feeding, sex, and establishing social heirarchy. They will attack anything within their sensory range during this time (7 days).", "A weathered and crumbling tower, 5 stories tall, suddenly appears along a well-used trade route. Those who have entered have not re-emerged, and there is a mystery here, more benign than diabolical. On the outside of the tower is the stuffed head of a hippopotamus.", "A temple to the local gods has vanished, leaving the population in a frenzy. This causes a religious schism, which may lead to a civil war in the region.

The harassment is constant, and deadly, and the Vegepygmies have sent for help to a local village, who have long been allies. The plant-folk offer their greatest treasure in return.", "A moai, of a beautiful humanoid, appears in the pool of a large waterfall, with leis of a rare and potent hallucinogenic flowers around its neck. If nothing is done, the statue will vanish in 48 hours. If the flower is ingested, however, the user will experience a literal meeting with a powerful fey and given a powerful new ability, or gift, but will be forever changed by the encounter.", "A temple to a dark god has been found by some explorers, who foolishly opened the lower tombs, releasing a wave of undead and bad magic that is starting to corrupt the countryside. There is a chance to avoid further damage by closing the tomb, but it will be very difficult.", "A dinosaur egg is found by the party. It has a viable embryo inside and if treated correctly, will hatch within the month. The species inside is, sadly, the last of its kind.", "An ancient deity has fallen from memory, but is still claiming power and fame within a native tribe. Their domain has morphed from the sun, towards water and aquatic life. Strange practices aid his service, and his tribes actively shun the current deity of the sun, disgrace it even, on the command of the fallen god.", "Red smokey tendrils float through the surroundings, they seem almost alive. Creatures that touch it, or smell it, tend to walk deeper into the tendrils and never return. It is said to be a creature that produces them, like a lure and line all at once. An underground lair filled to the brim with glimmering bones, a cornucopia of death.", "A wicked geographical scar lines the jungle, the size of a small hill. There is Eldritch power leaching from it, and multiple voices can be heard, speaking of sacrifice and untold powers that are there for a favor.", "The forest floor is flooding. Water is slowly rising, and the party has to negotiate the understory or canopy to escape it. That, or deal with constant attacks from swarms of piranha, caimans, and other river monsters now infesting the flooded jungle. The local primates and Aarocockra could potentially help them, if they ask nicely, or bargain effectively…", "Heavy sounds of logging echo through the jungle. A mercenary company from the Empire has arrived, intent on harvesting exotic wood for the ship trade and arcane industry. The mercenaries kill all natives and wildlife in their way, but do not go out of their way to destroy the jungle, their source of income. There may be profit in being hired as additional protection, or the locals may appreciate a hand in expelling the foreigners.",

A murder of crows watches from a nearby tree.", "The party discovers a local hamlet (a village with orchards) under siege by an Avenger and a pack of wild animals that appear to be under its control.

If challenged, the Avenger will order the bears to attack and being casting.", "A traveling zoo is passing through the area. If the party attends, the show is attacked by 2 Beastfriends and their canine allies. If the party does not attend, they will espy the Druids leading a docile line of animals through the area (perhaps while camped). In either case, the Beastfriends will attempt to free the animals and escape with as many as they can. If they kill the zoo workers, all the better.", "A friend of the party sends a letter inviting them to his birthday party in a nearby city. It takes place first at a racing track - dogs are the main event today, and the friend treats the party to a good time, and wins some money. After the race, on the way to the pub to continue the party, the friend is murdered by a snipers crossbow and a letter is found on his body from someone threatening his life. It seems the friend wasn't just a racing fan, but a breeder and owner. The letter orders him to stop what he is doing or else. It isn't signed but there is a bird's clawprint hastily stamped in blood at the bottom. A cabal of Beastfriends is taking down all the animal entertainment in the city simultaneously - there are 5 active cells on a schedule of 10 days.", "An awakened horse comes to the party and explains that it is a Druid, stuck (cursed) in this form. It begs for help and promises to reward the party with information or whatever you like. The Druid attempted to kill a Hag and failed. She is not close, but not too far either. She is ready for a counter-attack.", "The party comes across a weeping Druid, surrounded by the corpses of hundreds, perhaps thousands of rabbits. The whole area looks as its been dug up. There is a disease spreading. Its infected the rabbits first, and the Druid says that foxes and wolves are showing signs of it now as well. If asked, the Druid used the Dig spell to uncover the destroyed warrens. The Druid asks for help, and will recall a host of birds (mostly raptors) that he calls, 'the flock'. The birds do not feed on the bounty before them. The Druid speaks to and (mostly) controls them, but cannot predict the stubbornness of birds. The disease is natural, but amplified. Rabies 2.0. Its a mutation of evolution, nothing more. Its going to infect all the mammals if left unchecked.", "A murderous pack of Wererats has been discovered by a Beastfriend. The Druid has attempted to negotiate their withdrawal from the area, but they have refused, citing good hunting grounds. The Druid has escalated and turned most of the area's rats against the “verminthropes”. The party comes across an open battle between the Beastfriend and a massive swarm of rats, and a group of Wererats caught out in the open. If the party intervenes, they later discover that the Wererats have been turning others, boosting their numbers. If they do not intervene, they find out the same thing, only one of the party members gets infected.", "After the party awakens from a night of camping in a cave system, they see fresh graffiti scrawled on a nearby wall - 'LEAVE THIS PLACE'. If they do not, they become subject to a relentless series of guerrilla attacks and sabotage on themselves and their equipment. If the party kills any denizens, the Druid will confront the party directly. The Druid has local allies and is a few levels above the party.", "A Grey Druid staggers into a town, half-dead, and begs for aid. The Druid explains that the entire empire of the Porto (a Myconid group of colonies) has been destroyed by Drow and that the Elves are making their way towards the surface. There is only a few days remaining before they arrive.", "A Grey Druid is discovered trapped under a rock-slide. The Druid is dying and begs for death. If the Druid dies, a ring of twisted vines can be looted from the Druid's finger. If the Druid is rescued, they will become very angry and rant about the 'preservation of Balance', stating that healing magicks are an abomination to the 'natural cycles of the world'. If the party remains in the area, the Druid will begin to try and drive them out.", "A huge Dwarven vault-door blocks the party's passage through an underground area. Sleeping in a nearby chamber is a Grey Druid of an unusual race for the Order. The Druid cannot be woken by any means short of magic, and there is no way past the vault-door (it is highly enchanted with Abjuration magicks). If the party cannot wake the Druid, they can search the Druid and find a phrase written in Draconic. Its a magical trigger for the vault-door. Inside the vault is a Black Dragon that has been imprisoned for centuries. Its very angry and very happy to be released. Its name is Venomfang and its legendary. When the vault is opened, the Druid will wake and rage at the party's stupidity. Violence is most likely to follow.", "While the party is underground they will be approached by a Grey Druid who asks for their aid in quelling a war between two intelligent species. The war is threatening to destroy the entire ecosystem and spill out onto the surface world. They party will be outnumbered 10-to-1 if they agree, and will soon find themselves in the middle of the front lines, surrounded. The Druid's Order is coming to aid, but they will arrive too late.", "The party comes across a strange sight - a group of 4 Grey Druids worshiping at a standing circle of stones deep, deep underground. The area is lit with strange glowing fungus, and a large, dead, Carrion Crawler is sprawled across the sacrificial slab. Its been cut open and candles have been tucked inside, and lit. The Druids are chanting in some language (Infernal) and are attempting to summon a demon to help them destroy a particularly nasty Illithid colony in the area. If the party interferes, the Druids will flee.", "The party crosses into the territory of a Guardian and is suddenly under constant and covert attacks that seem like the party is being opposed by many enemies, but it is only a single Druid. The Druid will not speak or negotiate and will be very difficult to locate without magic. If pressed, the Druid will explain that the area they are trespassing in is proscribed by ancient law to remain free of any humanoids save a single protector.", "The party is contacted by an old Druid ally who says they have taken up the mantle of a Guardian and asks them to visit when they can. Upon visiting, the party discovers their friend has been slain and the thing they were protecting is gone/destroyed/other.", "A band of 5 Guardian Druids have closed the main road through a forest, and have stopped all trade and traffic. When asked for an explanation, the Guardians claim that the area was part of a unicorn's domain and now the Fey creature has been slain (they do not know by whom). When powerful Fey die, their spirits linger and sometimes can cause magical oddities to occur. The Guardians say this closure will be temporary (100 years) but they cannot allow anyone to be exposed to the danger.", "A dungeon that the party has arrived at is under the Guardianship of an awakened Elk, who was inducted into the Druidic Order, and has taken it upon itself to ensure that the dungeon remains sealed. The Guardian cannot say why, as its under the influence of a Geas (cast by the Grand Druid themselves), and begs the party to turn back. If they insist, the Guardian expresses regret and will fight to the death. If the dungeon is opened, something truly horrible is released.",
        "A sleeping Guardian is resting in front of a Gate, and appears unable to wake. In reality, the Guardian's body is now dead and it exists as an incorporeal spirit, with the same powers it had in life. It will not let the Gate be opened unless extreme need and a convincing argument can make it stand down.", "The party receives a letter from an old Druid ally who has joined the Order as a Hivemaster. The Druid begs for aid, as their beekeeping farm has become corrupted and Giant Bees and Wasps are now running amok, killing livestock and the local populace. A corrupted Druid, and enemy to the party's ally, is behind the events.", "The party finds themselves in a deep wood, among huge spiderwebs. The party gets ambushed by Giant Spiders, but before the encounter ends, a Hivemaster shows up, angry and threatening the party for killing his 'pets'. The Druid calls for Giant Insect reinforcements and bullies the party into leaving the wood. If left unchecked, this Hivemaster's arachnids will eventually populate the entire forest.", "While visiting a village, the party is offered honey at the Tavern, and told its local. If the party eats some, they become sickened and begin to suffer strange transformations - bee wings, antennae, and eventually a stinger. If the party does not eat the honey, they see the villagers undergo the same transformations. Told that a local Hivemaster has gone missing, the party will find the Druid, dead, and the trappings of a ritual that appears to have killed the Druid. Revenge or a curse, the party does not know, but time is running out before the transformations are permanent.", "A series of Giant Termite mounds begin appearing in local farmland, and the villagers are in a panic as the insects have begun devouring houses and local businesses. All attempts to drive the termites off have failed, and when the party arrives, the villagers are holed up in the local Mill - the only stone building in town. The villagers explain that their local Druid was driven off, accused of a crime it was later discovered they didn't commit. If the party searches, the Druid has taken up residence in a nearby wood, but refuses to help the villagers who betrayed him. He offers no advice and no explanation as to the termite phenomenon, but knows that it is the result of a Hag's curse.", "The party is contacted by a local Hivemaster who asks for aid in destroying a series of Giant Wasps nests in the area. The wasps have been killing locals and are breeding in numbers. The creatures have been naturally warped by a font of raw dweomer deep underground, its 'vapors' seeping to the surface and causing strange mutations (and not just among the wasps).", "An angry Hivemaster has decided to punish a local Elven village for defying their orders to slow their breeding down. The Druid has been casting Insect Swarm every day and harassing the colony. The Elves are at their wit's end and beg the party for aid. If the party confronts the Druid, the Hivemaster will show incontrovertible proof that the Elven presence is going to disrupt the local ecology, sending ripples throughout the web of life that will eventually result in this entire area becoming a wasteland.", "A Lost Druid has been waging a war of attrition on a human settlement that dared to raze a forest to make room for their habitation. The villagers are in a panic and believe the area to be haunted. They have sent out word that a reward is waiting for anyone to free them from this menace.", "The party receives a message from an old Druid ally that their mountain home has been poisoned by Duergar miners, who have allowed a radioactive metal to leech into the mountain's underground springs. The wildlife has all died and the plantlife is nearly extinct. The ally begs the party for help, and says that they are biding their time in a nearby swamp.", "A Lost Druid has fulfilled their vendetta, and has chosen to remain as an Avenger Druid, but refuses to give up the necromantic knowledge obtained in the process. The Druid has found a Necromancer mentor and will soon be a powerful multi-classed villain, hellbent on wiping out a huge colony of elves that turned the Lost Druid's former home of grasslands into a magical forest.", "A Lost Druid of the forest, now razed by Minoi (Tinker Gnomes) has sabotaged the Minoi's operations, turning their constructs against them, and now dozens of these 'rogue clank' are in the wild, indiscriminately hurting and destroying those that they come into contact with, as without proper controls in place, the constructs follow their prime directive - to convert all life into energy to be stored (and returned to the Minoi's labs). The Lost Druid will remain in the area until the Minoi are all destroyed.", "A Lost Druid of a freshwater lake, now destroyed by large-scale terraforming and allowed to become saltwater, has laid the area with hundreds of booby-traps, designed to mangle and kill. The Druid's rage is such that they will mock and taunt all who have been caught in the deadly traps and frees some of them to take back to the Dwarven terraformers as a warning.", "A Lost Druid of the Underdark has been forced to the surface after a Drow weapon scoured a huge section of the underworld clean - razed of all life and all sources of food and water, the area is now a silent, barren tangle of tunnels and chambers. The Lost Druid is distraught and howls with rage every evening, lamenting their former home. Locals believe that the forest where the cavern entrance was found is now home to some savage beast and they have let these fears ride on the tongues of merchants, who have spread the story far and wide.", "The party finds themselves stymied by a Druid who refuses entry into a local dungeon - citing the fragility of the ecosystem contained within. If opposed, the Druid will do everything in their power to frustrate, delay, and thwart their efforts inside the dungeon and out (and until they leave the area).", "The local road has been cut by a deep ditch and no traffic can pass. The party has been delayed by this action, and hears that the local Druid has done this to punish the local leader for disobeying a command to stop mining the nearby hills.", "The party comes across a strange sight - two opposing armies are seemingly frozen in time. All soldiers have been Held, and a Druid is walking among them, taking their weapons and placing them into a seemingly bottomless sack (Bag of Devouring).", "A Druid steps out of a Dragon's lair, explaining that they are the emissary, and that The Grand Drake is not interested in a fight with the party, and what can be done to facilitate their swift and quiet departure? The Druid has the dragon's proxy in the negotiations, and if attacked, will draw the wrath of the Dragon itself.", "A Druid is blocking the way to a monster's lair by casting Mirage Arcana wherever the party goes, in an attempt to dissuade them from committing violence against the species. The Druid explains that the ecosystem is delicate and if this species is destroyed, then the balance of the local web will become violently unstable.", "After slaying a powerful monster, a local Druid will cast Geas on one of the party members, compelling them to find another pair of the same monster and encourage them to mate successfully in order to restore the population's numbers.", "In the midst of an undead invasion/outbreak, the party sees a Druid putting down a large group at once with magic. If approached the Druid will ask for their aid, and if ignored, they will see the Druid later leaving the scene.", "A village caretaker Druid approaches the party and accuses them of possessing dark/necromantic magicks. The druid demands they hand the offending object over and wants to know where they obtained it.", "A Shepherd Druid is disguised as a tinker, and is giving away amulets to passers-by. The Druid will refuse all payment and guarantees their effectiveness against all forms of 'the shambling dead'. The amulet is real and will make the characters invisible to Zombies and Ghouls for 1 hour/day (the amulet does not have a command word, but will activate automatically in the presence of the creatures).", "A Shepherd Druid is attempting to complete a ritual, and the party is in the dungeon where the Druid needs to obtain the final ingredient. The Druid will fight for it, but is open to negotiation if the party is - the Druid will explain the ritual's purpose and ask for their aid.", "A local forest has become corrupted, and a rogue Shepherd Druid is the cause. The Order is sending agents to deal with the problem, but in the meantime, the locals are being terrorized.", "A dead Shepherd Druid is half-in, half-out of an open portal one of the Outer Planes. On the druid's person are 2 powerful weapons as well as a letter imploring the druid to complete some vital task.", "A druid finds the party, lost in a vast urban landscape. The druid offers to show them a shortcut in exchange for the delivery of a message to a dangerous individual.", "The party is confronted by a druid who claims that this part of the city is forbidden to outsiders and will back up his claim with a very large rat swarm (200 individuals) and a dozen feral dogs.", "A druid on a woven mat is selling herbal remedies at half the price of the commercial shops. The druid claims that the city provides all it needs to survive if we know where to look. If friendly, the Druid will ask the party to harvest some rare herbs in exchange for some herbal recipes.", "The party is stalked through the city by a huge pack of feral dogs (20+ individuals). The leader is a shapechanged Druid and is simply keeping an eye on some dangerous individuals (the party). If the party starts any trouble, the pack will intervene.", "The city's parks have been closed down by overgrown plant growth and the local Druid council has declared them off limits until the crisis is over (the details of which are not announced).", "The city's trees have been Awakened into a malevolent state and the local Druids are attempting to contain them, with little success.", "The Party meets a Wanderer Druid who is following an annual migration of large deer-types (Elk, Moose, etc...), who is happy to travel with them as long as they are going the direction of the herd. The Wanderer can offer a lot of information about where they have been in the recent past, and pass along any other news or rumors. At times, the Druid disappears from the company of the Party, and travels as part of the herd in wildshape.", "A group of Druids are chasing a renegade Wanderer Druid, whom they accuse of destroying their grove and murdering their fellow Druids (partially true). The group will be quite forceful in demanding information from the Party and/or local populace. The Wanderer is hiding among them as a local animal, watching and listening. If given the opportunity, the Wanderer will attempt to kill the posse.", "A Druid is trapped in a bog and is calling out for help. If assisted, the Druid claims that they are lost and are seeking a local landmark, where they plan to establish a new home. If questioned, the Druid will reveal that they left their homeland because of a terrible event/enemy, and that this peril is following them. The claim is true, and in only a few weeks, will arrive in the area.", "A local area is being hit with an unusual amount of storms. A Druid is calling these, tired of the locals interference in the ecosystem, and hopes to drive them out. If confronted, the Druid will fight fiercely, but flee if overwhelmed. If approached diplomatically, the Druid will reveal a deep emotional wound after their home territory was nearly destroyed by humanoid greed, and this is simply revenge.", "A Wanderer is in the area, clearing a forest of the undergrowth and destroying a large presence of predators in preparation of a new standing circle of stones to be erected, thus adding to the Order's power. The Druid will not take kindly to visitors or travelers, and will force trespassers to leave as quickly as possible, calling upon many animal allies to do so if necessary. The circle will take 10 years to construct.", "A group of unassociated Druids have been tasked to Wander to a region where humanoids are growing exponentially and the land cannot support them.

There is contention among the established circles about this new political entity.", "An entity is attempting to terraform the territory.", "Spore Druids begin worshiping Zuggtmoy, multiclassing into Warlocks to strengthen the coven. They begin to fill the forest with demons and fungal growth, and cover the canopy in an impenetrable layer of fungus, creating an Underdark above-ground. Illithids, beholders, drow, et al all come to this new surface Underdark and use it as a staging area.", "New religion moves in, calls all druids pagans, and works to remove them from the world", "A rogue movement of druids is sabotaging ecosystems, destabilizing them to the point of collapse. They operate in guerrilla tactics and small units, targeting linchpins that they know to be essential. Territorial Terrorism.", "Swamp druid, tricked by a sentient magic item placed by hags, opens a portal into Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze. Hags keep the portal open and begin to infiltrate the world. Druid thinks his territory expanding is natural, and his power grows. Other druids try to fight this but are consumed or 'accidents' happen when they try to oppose him. Swamp, ooze, and all manner of Inner planar creatures begin to destroy the world by turning it into a diseased festering swamp.", "A war/siege/disaster/plague has collapsed the regional city, and deurbanisation takes affect and the population pressure threatens the natural world. A solution needs to be found one way or another.", "A war has bred too many scavenger species such as ghouls and other foul macroplagues.

In their grandparent’s dying breaths, a promise was made to find and slay the beast.", "A doppleganger of the PC is spotted in the area where the PC grew up.

The old man seeks knowledge that only the PC knows.", "Word gets around about a potent performance-enhancing drug which significantly improves your strength but makes you courageously reckless.

But to refuse is to be disowned.", "A mount (warhorse, or whatever you like) begins following the PC while out in the wilderness.

It has questions.", "After a dungeon has been cleared, some local residents, grateful for the action, approach the PC and wish to have a statue commissioned in their likeness. This will take a week of 'modeling' in the area, and will turn out to be quite a nice piece, and the town will rename itself to something related to the PCs name (e.g., 'Grongtown'), and the PC will be a celebrity here (and in the near-surrounds).", "A young person approaches the PC and begs to be their squire.

It appears in a wrapped-box at the PC's home/campsite/wherever. A note on it says that it is from 'an admirer'. The weapon is unlike anything known to the PC and is obviously enchanted.

This is the gift of an odd outsider who likes to watch the Material Plane and give gifts to their 'favorite shows'.", "A Vrock/Hezrou/Marilith shows up with a bounty to collect on the PCs head. The fighter has made an enemy somewhere, and this demon is only the first. Many will come, and if 4 are defeated the enemy themselves shows up and accuses the PC of some crime.", "An ally of the PC, a tavern-owner, has died, and deeded the place to the Fighter, on one condition.

If the PC breaks this and goes to the tavern, it burns to the ground and a rash of murders are reported across the region in the next week.", "A gymnasium/arena/sports area that the PC has frequented is changing its name to honor the PC, to show respect for the PCs actions in the region.

The locations seem all very mundane, but they are guarded by some strange phenomenon, and all are located in far-flung places of the world. This will not be a short quest.", "A small animal has chosen the PC to be its companion. It is a normal animal, albeit with strong intuition and empathy, and does not speak. It will be a faithful friend until its natural death.", "The PC's favorite piece of kit (armor) has become rusted by some arcane meddling, and threatens to spread to all their gear and weapons. This is the curse from a vengeful Awakened Rust Monster whose family was killed by the PC.", "A Giant-type (Firbolg works nicely) has decided that the PC should have a friend.

The Giant draws a lot of unwanted attention to the PC.", "The PC's home town is the subject of a historical series of monographs and the PC's family is mentioned favorably (or unfavorably).

This is either real, or a cruel trick from a powerful enemy.", "The next time the PC gambles, or attempts to do something risky, they automatically succeed beyond their wildest dreams, but part of their hair/skin/body turns white/another color. Is this a blessing or a curse?", "A stranger approaches the PC, ragged and poor, with a small child/animal and babbles accusations of the PC being the father/mother of the small creature.

The reward is something that the PC has desired for a long time.", "A local noble wishes to commission the PC to design a fighting arena, and will pay handsomely for advice and blueprints. The arena is going to be used to commit crimes against the population, and the PC will attacked by assassins of the noble after the job is done, to ensure no one knows the truth.", "An ally of the PC has escaped from prison and has come to the PC for help. Law enforcement is not far behind. The ally is tattooed with a modified Wizard Mark that is being used to track them.
