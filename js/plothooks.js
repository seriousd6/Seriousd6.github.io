Upon visiting, the party discovers their friend has been slain and the thing they were protecting is gone/destroyed/other.", "A band of 5 Guardian Druids have closed the main road through a forest, and have stopped all trade and traffic. When asked for an explanation, the Guardians claim that the area was part of a unicorn's domain and now the Fey creature has been slain (they do not know by whom). When powerful Fey die, their spirits linger and sometimes can cause magical oddities to occur. The Guardians say this closure will be temporary (100 years) but they cannot allow anyone to be exposed to the danger.", "A dungeon that the party has arrived at is under the Guardianship of an awakened Elk, who was inducted into the Druidic Order, and has taken it upon itself to ensure that the dungeon remains sealed. The Guardian cannot say why, as its under the influence of a Geas (cast by the Grand Druid themselves), and begs the party to turn back. If they insist, the Guardian expresses regret and will fight to the death. If the dungeon is opened, something truly horrible is released.",
        "A sleeping Guardian is resting in front of a Gate, and appears unable to wake.

The party gets ambushed by Giant Spiders, but before the encounter ends, a Hivemaster shows up, angry and threatening the party for killing his 'pets'.

If left unchecked, this Hivemaster's arachnids will eventually populate the entire forest.", "While visiting a village, the party is offered honey at the Tavern, and told its local. If the party eats some, they become sickened and begin to suffer strange transformations - bee wings, antennae, and eventually a stinger. If the party does not eat the honey, they see the villagers undergo the same transformations. Told that a local Hivemaster has gone missing, the party will find the Druid, dead, and the trappings of a ritual that appears to have killed the Druid. Revenge or a curse, the party does not know, but time is running out before the transformations are permanent.", "A series of Giant Termite mounds begin appearing in local farmland, and the villagers are in a panic as the insects have begun devouring houses and local businesses. All attempts to drive the termites off have failed, and when the party arrives, the villagers are holed up in the local Mill - the only stone building in town. The villagers explain that their local Druid was driven off, accused of a crime it was later discovered they didn't commit. If the party searches, the Druid has taken up residence in a nearby wood, but refuses to help the villagers who betrayed him. He offers no advice and no explanation as to the termite phenomenon, but knows that it is the result of a Hag's curse.", "The party is contacted by a local Hivemaster who asks for aid in destroying a series of Giant Wasps nests in the area. The wasps have been killing locals and are breeding in numbers. The creatures have been naturally warped by a font of raw dweomer deep underground, its 'vapors' seeping to the surface and causing strange mutations (and not just among the wasps).", "An angry Hivemaster has decided to punish a local Elven village for defying their orders to slow their breeding down. The Druid has been casting Insect Swarm every day and harassing the colony. The Elves are at their wit's end and beg the party for aid. If the party confronts the Druid, the Hivemaster will show incontrovertible proof that the Elven presence is going to disrupt the local ecology, sending ripples throughout the web of life that will eventually result in this entire area becoming a wasteland.", "A Lost Druid has been waging a war of attrition on a human settlement that dared to raze a forest to make room for their habitation.

They have sent out word that a reward is waiting for anyone to free them from this menace.", "The party receives a message from an old Druid ally that their mountain home has been poisoned by Duergar miners, who have allowed a radioactive metal to leech into the mountain's underground springs.

The ally begs the party for help, and says that they are biding their time in a nearby swamp.", "A Lost Druid has fulfilled their vendetta, and has chosen to remain as an Avenger Druid, but refuses to give up the necromantic knowledge obtained in the process.

The Lost Druid will remain in the area until the Minoi are all destroyed.", "A Lost Druid of a freshwater lake, now destroyed by large-scale terraforming and allowed to become saltwater, has laid the area with hundreds of booby-traps, designed to mangle and kill. The Druid's rage is such that they will mock and taunt all who have been caught in the deadly traps and frees some of them to take back to the Dwarven terraformers as a warning.", "A Lost Druid of the Underdark has been forced to the surface after a Drow weapon scoured a huge section of the underworld clean - razed of all life and all sources of food and water, the area is now a silent, barren tangle of tunnels and chambers. The Lost Druid is distraught and howls with rage every evening, lamenting their former home. Locals believe that the forest where the cavern entrance was found is now home to some savage beast and they have let these fears ride on the tongues of merchants, who have spread the story far and wide.", "The party finds themselves stymied by a Druid who refuses entry into a local dungeon - citing the fragility of the ecosystem contained within. If opposed, the Druid will do everything in their power to frustrate, delay, and thwart their efforts inside the dungeon and out (and until they leave the area).", "The local road has been cut by a deep ditch and no traffic can pass. The party has been delayed by this action, and hears that the local Druid has done this to punish the local leader for disobeying a command to stop mining the nearby hills.", "The party comes across a strange sight - two opposing armies are seemingly frozen in time. All soldiers have been Held, and a Druid is walking among them, taking their weapons and placing them into a seemingly bottomless sack (Bag of Devouring).", "A Druid steps out of a Dragon's lair, explaining that they are the emissary, and that The Grand Drake is not interested in a fight with the party, and what can be done to facilitate their swift and quiet departure? The Druid has the dragon's proxy in the negotiations, and if attacked, will draw the wrath of the Dragon itself.", "A Druid is blocking the way to a monster's lair by casting Mirage Arcana wherever the party goes, in an attempt to dissuade them from committing violence against the species. The Druid explains that the ecosystem is delicate and if this species is destroyed, then the balance of the local web will become violently unstable.", "After slaying a powerful monster, a local Druid will cast Geas on one of the party members, compelling them to find another pair of the same monster and encourage them to mate successfully in order to restore the population's numbers.", "In the midst of an undead invasion/outbreak, the party sees a Druid putting down a large group at once with magic.

The druid demands they hand the offending object over and wants to know where they obtained it.", "A Shepherd Druid is disguised as a tinker, and is giving away amulets to passers-by. The Druid will refuse all payment and guarantees their effectiveness against all forms of 'the shambling dead'. The amulet is real and will make the characters invisible to Zombies and Ghouls for 1 hour/day (the amulet does not have a command word, but will activate automatically in the presence of the creatures).", "A Shepherd Druid is attempting to complete a ritual, and the party is in the dungeon where the Druid needs to obtain the final ingredient. The Druid will fight for it, but is open to negotiation if the party is - the Druid will explain the ritual's purpose and ask for their aid.", "A local forest has become corrupted, and a rogue Shepherd Druid is the cause. The Order is sending agents to deal with the problem, but in the meantime, the locals are being terrorized.", "A dead Shepherd Druid is half-in, half-out of an open portal one of the Outer Planes. On the druid's person are 2 powerful weapons as well as a letter imploring the druid to complete some vital task.", "A druid finds the party, lost in a vast urban landscape. The druid offers to show them a shortcut in exchange for the delivery of a message to a dangerous individual.", "The party is confronted by a druid who claims that this part of the city is forbidden to outsiders and will back up his claim with a very large rat swarm (200 individuals) and a dozen feral dogs.", "A druid on a woven mat is selling herbal remedies at half the price of the commercial shops.

At times, the Druid disappears from the company of the Party, and travels as part of the herd in wildshape.", "A group of Druids are chasing a renegade Wanderer Druid, whom they accuse of destroying their grove and murdering their fellow Druids (partially true). The group will be quite forceful in demanding information from the Party and/or local populace. The Wanderer is hiding among them as a local animal, watching and listening. If given the opportunity, the Wanderer will attempt to kill the posse.", "A Druid is trapped in a bog and is calling out for help. If assisted, the Druid claims that they are lost and are seeking a local landmark, where they plan to establish a new home. If questioned, the Druid will reveal that they left their homeland because of a terrible event/enemy, and that this peril is following them. The claim is true, and in only a few weeks, will arrive in the area.", "A local area is being hit with an unusual amount of storms. A Druid is calling these, tired of the locals interference in the ecosystem, and hopes to drive them out. If confronted, the Druid will fight fiercely, but flee if overwhelmed. If approached diplomatically, the Druid will reveal a deep emotional wound after their home territory was nearly destroyed by humanoid greed, and this is simply revenge.", "A Wanderer is in the area, clearing a forest of the undergrowth and destroying a large presence of predators in preparation of a new standing circle of stones to be erected, thus adding to the Order's power.

The circle will take 10 years to construct.", "A group of unassociated Druids have been tasked to Wander to a region where humanoids are growing exponentially and the land cannot support them.

The group does everything in their power to see that the PC is captured or killed.`, `(Divine Soul) The PC is visited every night (while sleeping) for a month by a Celestial being. The being is trying to convey information, but can only relay one word per dream.`, `(Shadow) The PC begins seeing into the Shadowfell, as an "overlay" to what they see in the Prime Material Plane. This vision is of the future, and something is coming.`, `(Shadow) Whenever the PC casts a spell above the Cantrip level, they see a being made of pure shadow watching them from a distance.

Soon a creature appears and demands that the PC translate a long and complicated piece of writing written in all 3 of the new languages.

If the PC accepts, the new languages may be kept.`, `(Storm) The next storm the PC encounters swells in power until is a tornado/hurricane.`, `(Wild) A Wand of Wonder appears in your hand.

Soon the owner of the wand comes looking for it, but the wand does not want to go back.`, `(Wild) For the next 7 days, the level at which spells are cast by the PC is random. After the 7 days, the PC gains 1 spell from a level they cannot cast yet, except they can for this spell. A week later another Wild Sorcerer finds the PC and explains that they are now infected with a magical disease. The gained spell is just one of 4 possible symptoms.`, `(Wild) Evil creatures stop attacking the PC in combat, and some may even help the PC if they are wounded or with a negative status effect. This continues for 5 combats, and then the PC is approached by a Devil who wants to know if the PC would like to extend their "free trial".`, `(Aberrant Mind) The next time the PC uses Detect Thoughts, the spell doesn't end for 30 days. After that time, if the PC is still sane, they can choose 1 person to "link" to, and be able to detect their thoughts all the time. The other person will gain the same ability.`, `(Aberrant Mind) The PC finds themselves slowly being transformed into a creature other than humanoid. The Source has decided that the PC is worth noticing, and this transformation can be stopped by a Remove Curse cast by a 15th level (or higher) Cleric, but this will sever the connection between the PC and the Source, and a new, powerful aberration steps in to make a new deal.`, `(Aberrant Mind) A group of aberrations have come looking for the PC, asking for the PC's help, but this is a lie. The group wants to extract the PC's soul and use it for a ritual.`, `(Clockwork Soul) The PC finds themselves embroiled in chaotic activity (brawls, riots, arguments, etc...) wherever they go, and they see Modrons appearing and disappearing at random around them.

Their Cantrips sometimes work, and sometimes fizzle, and this continues for 3 days. The PC then dreams of their Source embroiled in a fight to the death with a creature the PC has never seen before.`, `(Giant Soul) Every day for 6 days their "Giant Type" Source changes to one of the other "Giant Types". At the end, they PC may choose to switch their Source permanently. If they choose not to, their Source is so pleased that a magic item gift finds its way into the PCs belongings. If they do choose to switch, that type of Giant, from now on, is the sworn enemy of the PC and will attack them on sight.`, `(Giant Soul) The PC is approached by a large group of Dwarves who treat the PC as divinity and no amount of persuasion will make them leave. They plead for the PC to show them a "miracle". More show up every day. If the PC does a "miracle", the Dwarven people, as a race, will always treat the PC favorably. If the PC does not perform one, or tries to get away, the group will become angry and declare the PC a false god.`, `(Psionic Soul) The PC starts to feel the presence of another Psionic Soul nearby. If they investigate, they soon find that there are over a dozen of these presences in the area. Soon after the PC is attacked by one of these other Sorcerers. All of them are trying to kill one another. "There can be only one!" If the PC does nothing, they are attacked anyway, but without knowing the number of Sorcerers opposing them.`, `(Psionic Soul) The PC's Source grants them a new power in exchange for doing a task that the PC finds repulsive and horrifying. If the PC refuses, they lose spell access for 7 days, and then it is restored.`, `(Psionic Soul) A Githyanki Sorcerer, also a Psionic Soul, approaches the PC and asks for their help in completing a ritual that requires 7 Psionic Souls. The ritual's purpose is to permanently seal a planar gate from the Shadowfell to the Astral Plane, due to the constant incursions. If the PC agrees, they find themselves with 6 new allies. If they do not, they find themselves with 6 new enemies.`,

The murderers are still there (for the time being).`, `(All) The PC is challenged by another Warlock of the same Patron, who doesn't want any competition. This amuses the Patron, and allows it.`, `(All) Two Patrons are at war with one another. While it lasts, the PC will be able to detect any other Warlocks of the rival Patron within 1 mile. They will also be attacked periodically by Warlocks and their allies.`, `(All) The PC's Patron is so pleased, that they have deemed them worthy of learning a Secret. They may ask only one.`, `(All) The PC is told by a powerful ally of an ancient tome that will give them more information on their patron. The book, however, has the uncanny power to force the reader into a psychic struggle or forget its existence.`, `(All) The PC is asked by their Patron to do something contrary to their nature. It is a very difficult decision, but neither choice will upset the Patron. This was a test of character. In 1 day, the Patron leaves something the PC needs nearby, to find when they need it.`, `(All) The PC discovers that there is a cabal of Warlocks who are forcibly creating Warlocks out of innocent people. Contracts have been signed, and the deals are sealed. Their ranks have swelled, and soon they will be too much to handle without large-scale resistance.`, `(All) The PC has come into the possession of information that points to a Patron that seems more aligned with the PC's goals. The new Patron is a long time rival of the PC's Patron, and the offer seems too good to be true. DM's choice if it is, or isn't.`, `(All) The PC's Patrons directs them to form a cult around the idea that the Patron is coming to the Prime Material Plane. For a visit, and salvation/power/whatever, of course. The clock is ticking! The Patron wants the cult to do XYZ to assist the arrival.`, `(All) The PC is contacted by a stranger who claims to hold a piece of information that the PC or their Patron wants. The price for this information is up to the DM. The validity of the claim is also up to the DM :)`, `(All) A long-term plot of the PC's Patron has collapsed into utter ruin, and inadvertently, the PC is caught up in the pogrom. A shitstorm ensues, and the reputation and fortunes of the PC is this area are changed forever.`, `(All) A long-term plot of the PC's Patron has finally come to fruition, and the PC has the great fortune to share in the success. The reputation and fortunes of the PC in this area are changed, for the good, forever.`, `(All) The PC stumbles across agents of another Patron, and the PC has the opportunity to sabotage their plans. The Patron will remain silent, and see what the PC does. The two Patrons are allies, and this is a test.`, `(Archfey) The PC receives a unambiguous dream from the Patron that demands that they start upping their fashion game. The Patron wants to see the Warlock in expensive clothes and fancy hairdos. The requirements will continue to increase, with more and more extravagant demands, until the Patron gets bored. Along the way, the PC will gain a social enemy.`, `(Archfey) The PC's Patron has decided to pay them a visit - in the form of a fuzzy cat/cute puppy. The Patron will hang around and see what the Warlock is "really like when no one is watching" - and the way they conduct themselves may change the nature of the relationship. After the Patron gets bored, they leave.`, `(Archfey) The PC's Patron has fallen in love with a forbidden being. The PC is commanded to run messages between them, give advice to the Patron (or their lover), and other tasks that may become dangerous.`, `(Archfey) The PC's Patron needs the PC to be their "eyes and ears" and spy upon a powerful rival or faction. While doing so, the PC discovers a plot that will cause a lot of harm, locally. The PC has the chance to disrupt this plot (which they find morally distasteful), but at the risk of angering the Patron, who wants the plot to succeed.`, `(Archfey) The PC is commanded to kill the Patron's rival fey creatures (or just a certain type of fey in general), and open doorways to the Feywild so that the Patron's allies can come forth and spread their influence. To ever show mercy to an enemy is to risk severe punishment.`, `(Archfey) The PC is commanded to become friends with an enemy of the Patron. To insert themselves into their lives, learn their secrets, gain their trust. Ultimately, the Patron will want the PC to betray this individual, but the PC may have genuine trust and friendship at this point. What will happen if the PC refuses? If the PC agrees, the Patron will give them a powerful gift.`, `(Fiend) The PC's Patron wants the PC to write a contract for a possible new Warlock recruit. The language of the contract should be as obfuscating as it can be, while still being "legally" binding. This is a test, and if the Patron is pleased, new contract work may become available (and get the PC into some hairy situations).`, `(Fiend) The PC's Patron wants the PC to deliver a "package" to a distant location. The package is a living being, and is being taken against their will. The being will beg/bribe for release, and reveal some awful truths about the Patron's true motives.`, `(Fiend) The PC's Patron commands them to retrieve an object of some power from within the control of a very powerful enemy faction. The price for failure will be severe. The reward for success will be substantial.`, `(Fiend) The PC's Patron demands that the PC start taking a rare/expensive drug/drink/food that will "enhance their relationship", but in reality, is just another form of control. The Patron will continue to put these kinds of conditions on their relationship until the PC finally refuses. This has been a test. The Patron's reaction will be one of amusement or rage. Either way, the Patron will see the PC in a new light going forward.`, `(Fiend) The Patron wishes the PC to spend all of their wealth constructing a statue in the Patron's likeness. Refusal will only bring amusement and a reward. Compliance will further tighten the grip of the Patron.`, `(Fiend) The PC is commanded to kill a Warlock who dares to work against the Patron. The rebel Warlock is 3 levels higher than the PC, and is an ally of someone the PC is also allied with, although the PC and the rebel Warlock have never met, nor heard of one another. The ally made sure of this fact.`, `(Great Old One) The PC's mind is suddenly flooded with words. So many words, that must be written down or the PC's mind will crack. This activity takes many days and at the end, the missive has spelled out a dangerous idea/secret that could alter the world forever. It must be hidden from those who are seeking it.`, `(Great Old One) Strange and bizarre hallucinations affect the PC and seem to predict local events (mysteries, violence, supernatural events), and the locals have found this out (whether by betrayal or the PC's own actions - DM's choice) and have sought out the PC, demanding to know the future, and their own fates.`, `(Great Old One) The PC gets a feeling that "something must be built" and it will take time, money, and materials that would raise the eyebrows of people in authority if they knew (and they might find out). This construction will be well hidden, and must be guarded, and once completed, the PC can never look upon it or use it. It must be sealed up and forgotten, or risk madness.`, `(Great Old One) The PC gets a visitor one day, who hands them a note written in a language the PC suddenly realizes they understand. The PC is to escort the visitor to a distant location. The escorted being has its entire body veiled, and to gaze upon them, uncloaked, is to risk madness and death. There are a number of factions that have discovered this being is in the area, and will stop at nothing to capture it.`, `(Great Old One) The PC's Patron floods the PC's mind with a thousand voices, freely sharing knowledge it has gained over the aeons, but afterwards, only fragments remain. The PC has a vague idea of what has happened, but has a specific goal in mind - crystal clear - pointing to a distant location. When the PC arrives, something happens that changes them forever.`, `(Great Old One) The PC's Patron drives the PC to collect objects of power - most of them completely unrelated to one another, and to keep them secret, and safe. Doing so disrupts the power structures of many factions and the PC may soon find themselves surrounded by enemies.`, `(Hexblade) The PC's Patron has discovered that an artefact exists that can "unmake" it, forever. This cannot happen. This object must be destroyed, but it is guarded by the Patron's oldest enemy.`, `(Hexblade) The last enemy that the PC used a Curse upon, and wasn't killed, has gathered a group to kill the PC, and they have just finished setting up a spectacular ambush. If the PC cannot be killed, the group will attempt to steal as many items as they can from them.`, `(Hexblade) The PC's Patron has forgotten its name, and with it, some of its abilities and memories. The PC is asked to find the Patron a new name, one that still resonates with ancient power.`, `(Hexblade) The PC has been discovered by a group of Paladins who are on a pogrom to eliminate all the Warlocks of the PC's Patron. They are relentless and will use oblique tactics against the PC (going after friends, family, business, homes, allies - anything to force the PC to surrender, without actually killing/destroying any of the secondary targets).`, `(Hexblade) A portal to the Feywild is opening in the middle of a large population center. The PC's Patron wants this gate shut at all costs, as the ones doing the opening are a rival faction looking to assassinate the Patron. Time is running out.`, `(Hexblade) The PC comes across another Warlock with the same weapon - down to the name/accountrements/etc... One of these weapons is false, and someone has been tricked. If its the other Warlock, they will become an enemy of the PC (if given the opportunity). If its the PC, the Patron reveals the lie and explains why (or not).`, `(Celestial) The PC's Patron's most ancient enemy has finally been found. But they have had a genuine change-of-heart and have tried to dedicate their existence to undoing some of the damage they inflicted in the past. The Patron is adamant, however, and wants them destroyed. If the PC refuses, the Patron is pleased, and gives the PC some more autonomy. If the PC agrees, the Patron is displeased, and hands down a punishment. The Patron insists the PC is not a puppet, but an ally in a righteous cause, and as such, needs to think for themselves.`, `(Celestial) The PC's Patron points them towards a place that houses dangerous secrets. There is information here that the PC desperately needs, but by doing so, will cause a lot of collateral harm to the region. What price, truth?`, `(Celestial) The PC is commanded to destroy an artefact that threatens a very long time goal of the Patron, whose aims are so close to fruition. This is the last requirement, and if the PC fails, the fortunes of the Patron and their Warlocks will be drastically harmed. The artefact is very dangerous to those who handle it without care, but unguarded.`, `(Celestial) A cabal of Warlocks of a rival Fiend have been working in the region. The PC discovers this and is compelled to wipe them out/scatter them/destroy their powerbase/get them all arrested - and by doing so, will gain a powerful ally in this area. If they fail, the Fiend will notice and the PC has a new enemy.`, `(Celestial) The PC's Patron points them towards some antagonist from the PC's past. This being has been doing acts of great harm and has killed a popular/beloved/famous individual in the area, and is in the process of gaining more power. The Patron wants this being to be destroyed or punished. The enemy, however, has some very strong hold over the PC or their allies/family, and will most definitely use it if moved against.`, `(Celestial) The PC is commanded to start a new establishment in the Patron's name - a Guild, a Religion, an Order, etc... and draw others to the Patron's cause. The Patron's enemies, of course, will make this very difficult, and open violence all the way down to subterfuge will be employed to foil the attempt.`, `(Undying) The PC's Patron has commanded the PC to complete the tasks that they were unable to fulfill in life. The list is long and dangerous, of course, and will take months to complete. However, the reward for satisfying the Patron will be the answer to a question the PC has been wondering about for a long time, as well as a new set of allies and enemies!`, `(Undying) The PC's Patron has commanded them to find a new body parts for the Patron, as the one it has is falling apart. They must be parts that are fresh and healthy. There may be many of these needed. DM's choice.`, `(Undying) The PC's Patron is trapped somewhere, by its own mistakes, or the actions of others. It knows it cannot be freed, but wants the PC to find a way to let the world know that it still exists, to see what happens, and who might come looking for the Patron - all part of a larger plan.`, `(Undying) The PC's Patron is going to being entering a torpor - a period of inactivity where they will not be able to help the PC. During this time, the PC is instructed to guard the Patron's body/tomb/valuable resource/etc... When the Patron returns, they have a gift for the PC.`, `(Undying) The PC's Patron is under psychic/psionic attack from a rival, and the "leakage" is starting to affect the PC in the form of hallucinations, visions, dreams, and aphasia. This will continue until the PC can find a way to shield their mind or destroy their Patron's rival.`, `(Undying) The PC's Patron wants someone to replace them when they are gone (or the PC wants to become whatever the Patron is), and sends them on a series of quests to permanently alter themselves to become more like the Patron.`,

The bear is emaciated and bent forward, the hare is losing its fur in some spots. If interrogated, they are two awakened animals, used to go adventuring with a druid. She died years ago, and they’re both quite old, too old to go alone, so they just wait, playing cards together every day. If the players go back there at a later date, they will find the stump empty, covered in dry leaves (or snow, or cobwebs or what’s appropriated for the season.)", "The players hear voices from the trees.

After listening for a bit, they realize the actors are reenacting one of the players earlier adventures.", "Eating fermented fruit, animals can get drunk.

They are currently sleeping, wasted, at the edge of the forest.", "A treant accidentally damaged a merchant carriage going through the forest, to repay the damage he’s working as a clerk in the merchant office.

Emaciated and wounded, there is dry blood on her fur. The bear was the original owner of the dungeon until it was stolen from her. She was shoved in a room and left to die.

After a while, or if the pyramid is attacked or investigated, it fizzles and disappears.", "There is a corridor filled with enemies, lit by torches. Suddenly, all the flames go away, and unnatural darkness fills the area. Nobody can see through it. The players feel something cold and slimy brushing them, going towards the dungeon exist. Then, the lights turn back on. All the enemies are dead, cold, eyes-wide-open in terror.", "There is a table filled with food, in the middle of the dungeon. Some of the inhabitants are gorging themselves on it. No matter how much they or the players eat from it, the food never seems to end. It’s high-quality food, and of animals and plants from all over the world. If the players leave to come back later, they are unable to find this room again.", "In a section of the dungeon there are some rather elaborate graves covered in flowers and candles. They are very well kept, and the dungeon inhabitants seem afraid of getting close. There are no obvious marks that indicate who’s buried there, or at least none the players recognize.",

The entire town burns to the ground and everyone devoured by shadowy forms, unless the town sacrifices their children in a nearby cave system. In a cavern under the town sits an imprisoned Yugoloth. It's trapped in a circle of Binding, an impressive one, as the spell has persisted after its owner's death (whose body lays just meters from the trapped demon).

        "With a popping sound, an eyeball appears in mid-air. It rotates, looking around the room, then fixes on some apparently unimportant object. Then, a blue tunic appears around the eye. Then, two spindly arms. One holds a blank scroll, the other a quill. The thing, staring at the object silently, starts writing. There is no ink, hard to say what it’s writing. After a few minutes, it disappears.", "You hear a bubbling noise. In the middle of the room, in mid-air, something is dripping water, as if there was a hole just floating there. Rapidly, the hole gets larger and a lot of water flows out, but it doesn’t last long, and soon it’s just a drizzle. Through the hole you see somewhere else, a window to another place, maybe another plane. Wet stone, dripping chains, iron grates and the sound of the sea.", "A voice comes from the hole “Hello? Hello? Anyone here? I’m trapped, help me and I will reward you. I’m quite wealthy, okay? Hi? Hello? Fucking- if this spell failed again I swear…”", "The players find cultists performing a ritual, they’ve opened a portal and they’re trying to summon something. Problem is, whatever is on the other side, doesn’t want to come. As the cultists chant, trying their best to keep the ritual going, the cult leader is in front of the portal, begging, screaming, pleading, on the verge of tears. The entity on the other side seems adamant that it just won’t happen, for now.", "As soon as the villain is defeated, a lanky devil appears in a cloud of sulfur. It has a long grey beard, a floppy hat, long pointy black shoes and a staff. It laughs, spinning in mid-air. “Finally, I can get all my stuff back.” A horde of imps with sacs appear and start shoving everything in them. Books, furniture, cutlery. They throw every possible loot in the bags and disappear somewhere, as the large devil laughs and spins “You’ll never be done paying your late fees, you asshole!” it yells at the body.", "There is a hooded figure kneeling in a corner, crying and sobbing, covering their face with their hands. If the players try to approach, the figure shows their face: where the eyes should be is just a hole, a dark abyss that seems to go down hundreds of meters, cold and terrible. The players can hear a scratching noise echoing in the distance, then hands start crawling outside the hole in the person’s face. Hundreds of long, thin, pale arms, entangled with each other, pushing each other, with hands that claw and grab towards the players.", "There is a crackling, terrible smell of oil and sweat fills the room, making your eyes burn. A door opens, and you see a monstrous creature: a tall, insect-like humanoid, with six thin, hairy limbs, large compound eyes and long fangs dripping with black oil. In one hand, it holds an empty sac. In another, a scale. “A debt must be repaid. Baalzebul, The Perfect, Lord of the Seventh, demands what is due.”", "A group of masked individuals barges into the room, breathing heavily. They are covered in leather and spikes, with contorted, demonic, red masks covering their faces. They all hold strange weapons, blades with way too many curves and spikes to be functional. “Oh, finally.” You hear one of them say. They all appear quite excited and cheerful, if tired. “Hey, look, we’re sorry but we have to kill you. We have a murder quota and, well, we’re really behind. Nothing personal, really, normally we’d never do such a sloppy job but we’re in a terrible hurry so… yeah.”", "A geyser erupts out of the ground, making everything shake. Rocks, dirt and scolding water rain all around. From the column of water emerges a fish person, followed by a second, then a third and a fourth. They are all wearing scale armour and wielding weapons that appear to be made out of coral. “The hour of reckoning cometh, driers” Yells the first fish person. “Soon the great sea will flood your entire, miserable, water-less lands and the great elemental water will take its rightful place atop the world. Prepare for your humid demise, dry fiends”", "A deafening roar shakes the entire building, followed by the crashing of stone and wood. As you get close, you see a large portal, on the other side of it you can see a luxurious forest with enormous trees. You see a massive creature, similar to a lizard, but a hundred times larger, with a colossal jaw and tiny arms. It’s on the ground, its weight crushed a wall. There are many wounds on the beasts, spears and arrows sticking out of it. Standing triumphantly on top of it is an enormous dwarf, muscular enough to be mistaken for a short ogre, and twice as hairy. Barechested. It has an axe in one hand, and a spear in the other. Around the beast, numerous slender people wearing wooden masks and green cloaks. They all have bows, spears or hooks. “Bloody heavens what a majestic hunt. My blood is lava.” Screams the dwarf. “I’m damn pumped, this isn’t enough. You!” he yells, pointing at the players. “You look strong. Fight me. You are being hunted by Doborovir Ironcrush, greatest hunter in Ysgard. Be honoured, and put up a good fight as I skewer you!”", "A door opens, and a trio rolls out. One is a tall, cloaked figure wielding a long sword. The other look like regular folks, a male elf wearing a jacket and a dwarf woman in a dress. The three are fighting, grappling and hitting each other. “Get out of my tavern, you freak!” screams the man in red while dragging the cloaked one to the ground. “The dwarf looks around and says “I don’t think we’re in your tavern anymore, Gerard. Or in Sigil, for that matters.", "There is long, high-pitched noise, then a flash of orange light, then a very large, decorated, brass sphere appears in mid-air, it hoovers for a while, then it crashes down making everything shake. A door opens and two dwarves with bronze skins and flaming beards roll out. A third, larger Azer walks out behind them, screaming profanities, and starts kicking the first two in the ass, yelling something about a goblin smacking his face on the instruments being able to make better calibrations.", "You were the only people in the room, you are sure of that, but all of a sudden you notice an intruder. In a corner is sitting a hooded figure. Its long, blue robes cover its body entirely, and it’s perfectly immobile. In front of it, a tiny table. On the table, several items. They all seem… wrong. Slightly misshapen, the wrong colour, the wrong smell maybe, but you can’t pinpoint exactly what. All you know is they give you a strange uneasiness, and a bizarre crawling sensation up your spine when you stare at them too long.", "The ground explodes, and from the dust emerges an elf holding a golden and white flag. She’s wearing a very elaborate, snow-white armour that resembles a swan, a long white cape and a scimitar hangs from her golden belt. “Beware, fiends and evil-doers, holy retribution cometh on alabaster wings! Come forth, a righteous bulwark awaits. Reveal yourself, and ye shall be crushed ‘till no bone is left unbroken, no blood is left unspilled and no muscle is left untorn! A scorching for the ages up your sinful a- oh, well met, travellers.” Every word is screamed at the top of her lungs.", "Growing out of a corner of the room, like a sort of repugnant tumour, is an orange, pulsating sac filled with liquid surrounded by tendrils. Next to it a pale humanoid, naked and featureless. Its face is completely blank. It wiggles its long, slender fingers toward you, and on its face appears a slit that turns into a disturbingly large mouth. It speaks “Heeelllooo, ladies and gentlemen. Mmmmh. Adventurersss, I take it? How quaint. Sssay, perhaps are you wouuunded? Tired? This here pod contains the best healing juices you’ll eeeever find. In but a minute you’ll be good as new, for a minuscle fee. The soothing sap, glopping and stirring, plip plop. It’s a very pleasant experience if I can say so myself. Anyone interested?”", "There is an elf, breathing heavily, kneeling in a corner of the room. She’s wearing leather armour, a backpack and goggles. She’s smoking, as if she just jumped out of a furnace. She looks up at you with a smile, and speaks, even if with some difficulty “Hey, hi pant, how’s it? Say, do you happen to know what plane this is? huff I believe I’m a bit lost.”", "As the players are fighting, a Djinn appears and starts taking notes. He explains he’s gonna buy the location, as soon as the players have cleared it. Don’t mind him, he won’t disturb.", "The evil gods gave a blessing to the villains. Too bad it came in the form of a slobbering, stinking, roiling mass of flesh that has been rolling around, plaguing the place. The bad guys don’t even understand what they’re supposed to do with it, so they’ve just locked it up somewhere. If free, it starts going around with no apparent logic.", "Aurora borealis appears in the area. A faint song can be heard in the distance, muffled, as if coming from a dream. Horns play, then words, a poem. They talk of great deeds, adventures, heroes of the past. After a while, it dissipates. The players feel refreshed and full of energy. It is an echo from Valhalla: sometimes they can be heard by heroes on a battlefield, echoing in all corners of the universe.", "As an opponent is defeated, a look of terror runs across their face. A metallic door appears, it slams open, noxious gasses and sickly green arms pour out, grabbing the poor enemy. As they are dragged inside, screaming and kicking helplessly, laughter echoes in the room, then a voice “time to pay your debt,insert enemy name here], I hope you enjoyed our gifts, while they lasted.” It closes and disappears, leaving only a terrible smell behind.", "A bunch of wet fish drop from the ceiling. They slap the players on the head and flop helplessly on the wet floor. Sometimes, when a lot of magic is used in one place, planar boundaries soften a bit, it happens. It’s probably nothing to worry about.",

The coachman will be very encouraging and optimistic about the next stop being enticing, and is according to the coachman a renowned tailors. In the dingy shop a short scowling man will stalk the players as they browse the store, seizing any opportunity to try and convince them to buy his garments. At this point the players will have little sense of where they are without some means of navigation. The coachmen is adamant that the last stop will make it all worth it. The final stop from the outside appears to be a theatre with elaborate decorations and promotions. An attractive host recieves them at the doors, and leads them down a dimly lit hall, through another set of doors and into an empty auditorium. She tells them to take a seat at the front by the stage before retreating to the double doors and locking them. (2d8+3) thugs rise from the concessions stands with loaded crossbows aimed at the players heads, and the amiable man strides out on to the stage. He demands the party's valuables in exchange for their lives. ",

The tricky dwarven fighters have specialized on pushing off opponents as soon as they enter, and those who are hardier and can hold their ground and reach the finals find that the surface starts to spin, using centrifugal force to slide them off (the champion, of course, doesn't even try to fight and just holds to the post) ", "A group of city guards are clustered around the entrance to an alleyway.
