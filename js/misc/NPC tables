    Motivations
    d4 - You Asked, So I'll
    Tell you a blatant lie, because I don't like you or because I'm afraid.
    Tell you a half-truth, because I don't trust you or because I'm afraid.
    Tell you the truth, but mix up all the details, because I want to trust you, but I'm afraid.
    Tell you the truth, because I like and trust you, or I need help.

    d20 - Why Am I Doing This?
    To gain wealth.
    To gain power.
    To fulfill a promise.
    To get revenge.
    To get justice.
    For the glory.
    To gain the favor of someone.
    To help a friend.
    To stop an event.
    To pay a debt.
    To solve a mystery.
    To escape from a problem.
    To thwart an enemy.
    To expose the truth.
    To cover up the truth.
    To gain my freedom.
    To liberate others.

    d4 - When Will I Give Up?
    As soon as I meet a serious setback or if I, or anyone else gets hurt.
    As soon as there are a lot of obstacles, or if I, or anyone else gets seriously hurt.
    As soon as someone dies.
    Never. I will die before I give up.

Villain Motivation
    Betrayal - the person feels that they have been wronged and deeply desire revenge, thinking it will make them feel better. We all know that it rarely does. This leads to feelings of injustice and that can spiral out of control and lead to all sorts of damaging thoughts that can escalate into treating others as if they have no value.
    Disenfranchisement - Someone who feels that they have no place in society can become deeply bitter and that can escalate to any number of emotional outlooks - anger, hatred, rage, rape, murder, terrorism, zealotry, and nationalism.
    Trauma - life events that have shattered someone's psyche are probably the most common reason people "go bad". They might have been abused as children or adults - physically, sexually or psychologically. This sets up a cycle of depression and anger that can sometimes spiral out of control and the next thing you know they are walking the streets with a rifle.
    Envy/Greed - when people are denied the things they feel they deserve, they can sometimes feel deeply resentful and start to make bad decisions in an effort to get what they want. This always leads to a grab for power, and as we all know, absolute power corrupts absolutely.
