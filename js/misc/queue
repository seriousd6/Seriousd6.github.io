        A floating chest that when anything is removed from it creates a inescapable barrier around it that only goes away if the item taken, or something of equal or higher value is placed back in the chest. 
        A mirror that shows a parallel dimension version of whomever looks into it, with slight to large differences being shown. 
        A skull that can speak and remembers it's former life, but can do nothing else. 
        An enchanted broom that cleans on its own, but also has a personality of a disgruntled dog.

        A magical vending machine that when a gold is deposited, it creates and gives a 3' wood statue of who ever is standing in front of it. 
        Giant ceramic jars with holes in them for air, and a trickle of water. The jars are the size of houses and magically sedate (and then force into hibernation and then stasis) anyone who enters them in short order. They are a form of larder for keeping sentient creatures alive and fat until thier time to be eaten. 
        A crown that puts the wearer to sleep, but then transforms the world around them into a twisted version of what they are dreaming. The dream ends if the crown is removed. The more powerful lucid dreamers can even interact and live in this dream world, which grows larger the more powerful they are. 
        A porthole of desire. There's some standing stone, with a hole carved out through to the otherside. It shows the observer the greatest desire of a person they are observing through the porthole, examples include a spider subject where everything is covered in webs, and dog and their owner playing together, or an ork burning down the world. 
        A prayer wheel assembly with a near infinite number of runes in an ancient and pre-verbal form of celestial. With it, one might spend a 5th level spell slot and gain a use of a spell similar to Commune with a deity that is within 1 step of the caster's alignment. They may ask up to 8 questions, but the DM must SECRETLY flip a coin each question up to a maximum of 2d4-1 times (max once each question). On tails, the answer she gives must be False or a Lie. If Heads, instead the answer must be True, if cryptic. After the 2d4-1 confusions have occured, then the resulting answers must be True. Using the device more than once per day requires a DC15 Wisdom save, or the user takes a point of exhaustion. 
        An eternally screaming fire skull. It’s not in pain or anything, just bored. Giving it something that might distract it might stop the screaming. 
        A black stone statue of a frog filling a cubic foot, weighing 150 lbs. Expend a spell slot of at least level one. Every flying insect, bug, creepy crawly, and flying vermin of size Tiny or smaller within a 40 foot cube centered on the frog is snatched by shadowy lashing tongues of force. After 1 hour, roll a d6. On a 5 or higher, the item creates 1d3 goodberries. The statue continue snatching insects for 1d4 hours after activation, a higher level spell slot multiplies the duration. Roll again for goodberries after each hour. The frog is capable of attacking swarms as well, dealing 1d6 hp worth of damage to the swarm or single Tiny flying creature within its range of effect every round, for the duration. 
        Orb of Distant Sight: A crystal sphere the size of a basketball, weighing 50 pounds. Spend a 1st level spell slot, and an image of anything located within a 40 foot cube (within line of sight of the orb, and within a maximum range of thirty miles, or the horizon, whichever is closer) is shown, projected within a 10 foot cube adjacent to the orb, as per the spell Silent Image. The image updates in real time. Using a full round action, the area spied upon may be moved up to 40 feet per round, within range, and the Orb's effect lasts for 1d10 minutes. Spending a higher level spell slot multiplies the duration of effect. Additionally, once per day, spend a Level 1 spell slot, and the Orb may be used to project an image in the reverse manner to a point within the same range, as per the spell Silent Image for 1d10 rounds. Higher level spell slots multiply the duratiom of this effect. Using the orb in this manner prevents its use for any other purpose for a full 8 hours. 
        Altar of Imbuement: A smoked boxwood altar three feet to a side, with fine ivory handles wrapped in gold wire and decorated with cabochons of Onyx and Amber. A fine golden chalice is mounted inside the altar. Place a magical item that has at least 1 charge remaining, expend a divine spell slot of at least level 1, and pray for 8 hours; roll a d6, on a 5 or higher the item will regain 1 charge (up to a maximum of 3 charges in a 1 month period, or 6 charges per year, whichever happens sooner). Spending a higher level spell slot reduces the required d6 roll, becoming automatic when a 6th level divine spell is expended. 
        The Burning Bell: A courtroom with a sinister looking, large-sized black-iron bell (with no clapper) with adamantine bands is mounted six feet above the floor in a central position. The bell weighs over 200,000 pounds and is twenty feet tall and ten feet across at the base. When rung, it peals at B♭-1 (14.5 Hz) and can be heard for up to 10 miles. While painfully loud, a strange property of the amphitheater is that it protects those inside it from the bulk of hearing damage from the bell's peal. A marble dais is built directly beneath the bell, while a second (more ornately carved) is nearby. The sound of the bell is almost completely muted while standing on either dias. The courtroom is shaped like an amphitheater, with rising levels of seating behind the second dias. The bell (and surrounding temple courtroom) is covered with bas-releif pictoglyphs in a forgotten tongue, the glyphs demonstrate a man standing burning beneath the bell, while those surrounding fall to thier knees. Spend a spell slot of at least third level, and the bell peals, sustaining itself for 3d6 minutes, a higher level spellslot multiplies the length of this effect. While active, anyone hearing the bell (including those on the dais) is under the effects of the spell Zone of Truth. Attempting to lie causes physical pain (and potentially damage) that increases to a maximum beneath the bell. Within the first d6 minutes, the Will DC beneath the bell is equal to the 16+caster's proficiency bonus. This decreases by 1 for every d6 minutes or 100 feet of distance (to a minimum of DC10). Those who lie while beneath the bell suffer 3d6 Sonic damage and 3d6 fire damage (reduced by 1d6 for every 10 feet of distance or d6 minutes, to a minimum of 2 sonic and 2 fire). They may attempt a CON save equal to the same DC (as to lie) to only suffer half damage. 
        Goblets of Shattering: A set of at least seven fragile musical crystal goblets. Up to once per hour, when all are played at once, it casts the spell Shatter against targets within range. Roll a d6. On a 1, this causes one of the goblets to break as well, but the damage dealt is doubled. If all the goblets are broken, the magical set no longer functions. 
        The Whispering Pillars: A set of 60 foot tall pillars, intricately carved. Anyone seated at the top of a pillar suffer the following effects (during) and up to 1d6 hours after leaving: Blinded (CON DC15 resist), Silence (WILL DC15 resist), and Slow (DEX DC15 resist). While seated at the top of the pillar, the creature gains ADV on sound based Perception checks and a +5 bonus, being able to hear even a whisper up to ten miles away, as if they were right next to the whisperer. Additionally, once per eight hours, the listener may use the effect of the spell Detect Thoughts against one creature they perceive within 1d6 miles. 
        A heavy gold plated metal washtub weighing 300 pounds. Six feet long, three feet across and three feet deep. When mostly filled with clean warm water, any object or creature placed within the tub is cleansed as per the spell Prestidigitation. It also smells strongly of either rosewater, jasmine, orange blossom, mint, smoked sausage/bacon/steak, sandalwood, patchouli, or lavender (roll a d8), for up to one hour. 
        A Giant Pendulum in a Garguantuan Grandfather Clock: Movement speed in the room is doubled, but all creatures in the room are under the effects of Slow (Will DC 15, resist at start of each round) or Haste (Will DC 15, resist at start of round), determined by a coinflip for each creature upon entering the area, or at the start of thier turn. 
        A fancy room with a very accurate dollhouse inside that creates dolls of anyone or anything within 100 feet. Interacting with the dolls or furniture moves and affects their counterparts as well, and againstvliving creatures the effect is like that of a Voodoo doll (Will/Str/Con DC 15 to resist at the start of the round. Resist three rounds and you are immune to the effect until your next long rest.) Each round, the contents of the house reflect reality. Damaging or destroying the dollhouse deals an equal amount of damage to all within range. 
   
    mystic grimoires
        This grimoire
        is bound with a cover made from human teeth and nails.
        was inked with the discoloured blood of inhuman beasts.
        is a mere fragment of a greater work, all that could be preserved from a purge.
        is, or has become, a living creature. Its pages pulse with a faint heartbeat, and absorb unwary worms for sustenance.
        has synaesthetic text, words that are smelled or felt more than read.
        changes its exact wording each time it’s read.
        always appears in the dreams of those who’ve read it before, where it remains perfectly legible.
        will pluck at the strings of fate to place itself in the possession of ambitious sorts if it’s sealed away for too long.
        is a glass puzzlebox which projects its text when a light is shone through it. Rearranging it reveals another segment of text.
        has increasingly deranged marginalia scribbled in a dozen different hands in its open spaces.
        makes you speak its words aloud as you read it, someone else’s voice coming from your throat.
        appears to be written in gibberish until you add your signature to the many that fill its otherwise blank front page.
        glows with a sickly light, so that it is legible even in total darkness.
        seems fated to injure its readers. One can scarcely turn a page without getting a papercut.
        has a section of actual human spine as its spine.
        is fireproof, and can only be read in full by immolating it.
        causes its reader’s eyes to bleed. Reading it too much inflicts blindness, as readers become unable to see anything but the grimoire.
        is a stack of clay tablets. There’s more tablets in the stack than it seems there should be based on its size and weight, and any tablets removed or destroyed inexplicably return to the stack.
        heals any damage done to it, leaving a mottled scar.
        is written in a code that takes sustained effort to crack. Without this effort, it seems to be a mundane cookbook.
        DThis grimoire was written
        by a doomed poet who dove deep into a mystery cult for inspiration.
        by a scholar who claimed to have tapped into the Akashic Records, where all knowledge is stored.
        by a popular medium while in a trance, shortly before their mysterious disappearance.
        by a priest who became obsessed with dubious apocrypha.
        by an unknown authour. It simply appeared in history one day.
        by an entire village, one page to a person, before they walked together into the night, never to be seen again.
        by a thousand deranged monkeys.
        by the head doctor of an asylum, based on the rantings of their patients.
        by the hands of an infamous thief, after they were cut off as punishment.
        by a historian based on their collated research on several lost civilizations.
        by a child who claimed to have been inspired by their imaginary friend.
        some time in the future. What you might find of it now is an imperfect, backwards copy anticipating its own original.
        shamefully, by a secret heresiarch.
        apparently long before any other example of written language.
        by a self-proclaimed prophet who claimed to have received its text in a god-granted vision.
        by a hermit best known for throwing their feces at visitors.
        by a jaded noble who brought ruin to their estate in pursuit of limit-experiences.
        by a professor and their closest students, who barricaded their university and slaughtered the rest of the inhabitants.
        as a bowdlerization of a yet more dreadful tome.
        by the hands of the true creator of the world, allegedly.
        DThe lore which this grimoire contains
        is rituals to summon demons, though not to control or banish them.
        is how to mix potions which induce mutation.
        is the secret names of angels, which allow them to be bound against their will.
        is the location of a dormant undead army and the means to command it.
        is how to open portals to inchoate realms beyond the conventional cosmos.
        is knowledge of how to enslave human souls to animate fell golems.
        is rituals to transform oneself into a kind of intelligent undead: a vampire, a ghoul, a lich, and stranger sorts besides.
        is a tragically flawed ritual to resurrect the dead.
        is spells to cook together living things into hybrid monsters.
        is rites to commune with a banished and vengeful divinity.
        is a rite to shuck one’s own dooms, curses, and misfortunes onto a more innocent scapegoat.
        describes how to slip one’s soul away from just punishment in the hereafter, or damn another to far worse than they deserve.
        is rituals to transfer your mind into another’s body, consuming their self in the process, or to splinter off pieces of your mind to fester and infect another’s.
        is how to call up plagues, but not how to cure them.
        is the method to create a sphere of annihilation.
        can be used to immanentize the eschaton.
        is knowledge of how to remove human organs and replace them with empowering alien substitutes.
        is how to steal life-force from others to enhance and extend one’s own.
        is charms to bend the minds of others.
        is how to steal and pervert divine magic.
        DThis grimoire was forbidden
        so that its temptation to prospective seekers would be increased.
        not for the lore it contained, but rather for its satirical preface which offended a political leader.
        because hidden in its text is a memetic weapon that drives readers mad.
        because its cover forms a seal that unleashes a malign spirit while it is open.
        because it’s a failed attempt at a phylactery, and so its writer(s)’s ghost(s) can haunt anyone who’s read it.
        because it was used to facilitate an atrocity.
        due to the blasphemous ideas its text promulgates.
        because none of its lore is accurate, and is in fact a trick for an even darker purpose.
        because reading it is a spiritual hazard that dooms one’s soul to a truly unfortunate afterlife.
        because it’s proof of the limits of safe, sane magic.
        because of the machinations of a sorcerer who thought it plagiarized their own work.
        because it was once the key element in a plot to hasten the apocalypse.
        because the lore it contains could destabilize the natural order of things.
        because prophecy held that great evil would follow if it were not kept out of sight of perusing eyes.
        because the gods have a habit of smiting indiscriminately around it.
        by a tyrant who didn’t want anyone else to be able to tap its power.
        due to popular demand.
        because as it’s read it refines and expands on itself by reading in turn the minds of its readers.
        because the publishing house that owns the rights to it gets violently litigious if there’s any chance it might be copied.
        as an excuse to seize it for an authority’s use.

        in the lab of a researcher trying to extract insights palatable to conventional magical practice.
        in a revolutionary’s hideout, as a weapon of last resort.
        as the heirloom of a clan of backwoods hedge-witches.
        in a tower on a barren island, its garrison all dead of simultaneous suicide.
        sorted among mundane codexes by a senile bureaucrat.
        locked in a safe in an inquisitor’s office.
        in the possession of an orphan being groomed by a loose familiar to become an obedient archmage.

        14	The Satyr's Pact: A tavern run by a satyr who offers musicians a deal. If they impress him and the crowd with a song they earn a instrument that is always in tune and free room and board for life. If they fail, they work in his tavern for a decade but can audition again for the same deal, years do add up. (u/PMMeYourHappySmile)

He explains that he specialises in the sale of imps, but so far the only ones he has been able to obtain (trade secrets and all) have limited lifespans. It's a mixed bag in his opinion so all the imps cost the same. Imps cost [1d20/1.33] GP each, half this if it's raining. On purchase the imp is bound to the character until the imp's unique demise. Each imp has a craving and a fear; if the character is helpful in these regards the imp's loyalty will improve. Each imp also holds a secret agenda of mischief. (u/ApertureJunkieZA)

        29	Murray's Theatrics: The half-elf Murray retired from the life of a wandering bard eight years ago, but still loves the trade dearly. His shop (which is really just the anteroom to his house) stocks sheet music and scripts for the lutist looking to expand her repertoire, or the troupe seeking to get ahead of the new fashion in comedies. The texts cost next to nothing - Murray remembers what it's like to travel on a performer's income. The real money comes from his younger brother, Astor, whose potions create audience-dazzling special effects. (u/ButtPoltergeist)
        30	The Furrowed Brow: Esmeralda Turnbottom's mother made wards, and her mother made wards, and her mother made wards... And Esme has never been one to spoil a good tradition. The wares range from mundane (a pendant against forgetfulness, carved from gingko bark) to the specialized (ground cat's tooth to drive off harpies). Once a year, she closes up shop for a much deserved vacation, and returns with an armful of oddly specific wards. Such as "protection from a stampede of your own cattle frightened by a thunderclap on a moonless summer night". And yet they always get bought, and they always end up useful... (u/ButtPoltergeist)
        31	The Sizzler: An exotic restaurant run by a very jovial, and very fat, half-ogre named Thog. They specialize in rare meats of all kinds and will pay well if what you have is fresh. From drake wings to spider legs, if it's fresh and serviceable they'll buy it. Their meals are renowned for being tasty and surprisingly filling, and the exotic nature of their ingredients has been known to impart certain temporary boons to the consumer. The house special is constantly changing, so get in quick before the line forms! (u/Kami-Kahzy)
        32	Nero's Place: A shop run by an aging, paranoid neurotic elf that is convinced there's a demon after him. Nero sells a wide assortment of scrying crystals, mirrors, looking glasses, and patented listening tools that he uses on a daily basis. Some of his inventions are actually helpful, like his 'Peek-around' that angles two mirrors inside a square tube to look around corners. Others are less helpful, like his 'Hearing Helm' that is basically two gramophone bells welded onto a bucket. He also sells protective charms and wards to help keep... well anything off your back, really. For the paranoid inside us all, Nero's Place is the Place for you! (u/Kami-Kahzy)
        33	Goldie's Locks: a wig shop selling enchanted wigs that are just right. (u/AnAverageWolf )
        34	The "ooks" Store: A dingy store front window displays "ooks" peeling gold lettering. Inside the dimly lit shop are shelves upon shelves of musty old volumes fill up the space until only narrow paths await the adventurous customer. After searching the store you might find what you want...or need in the future. (u/Wandererdown)
        35	The Amazing Omar's Shop of Curiosities: Omar, a flamboyantly dressed merchant waves, you over to his display wagon to view his wears. Various charms, potions, knick-knacks, and unguents are on display for all to see. If you are a polite and interested customer he may be persuaded to showcase his more interesting items... (u/Wandererdown)
        36	Adon's Exceptional Reflection Collection: A good sized shop that sells mirrors of various shapes and sizes, run by a reclusive and eccentric old gnome named Adon. Mirrors hang from almost every surface, with some even dangling from the ceiling or the bottom of other mirrors. It is incredibly easy to get lost wandering the store, and the inside seems significantly bigger than its outside appearance belies. An observant customer will notice that some mirrors occasionally reflect fantastic locations with startling realism. (u/ThePragmaticPimp)
        37	Ketterman Barley's Stonecarving and Statuary: Ketterman is a stone carver of some renown, and does all kinds of stonework from bas-reliefs and fountains to statues and headstones. He's expanded his business recently by offering smaller, personal busts of the client for a reasonable sum, depending on the quality of the stone. Ketterman typically sells to the upper class, but as long as you can pay he's more than willing to work with just about any customer. But here's the catch: Ketterman is actually an accomplished diviner as well. Every time he carves an eye into his stonework he can use those eyes to scry through at any time. Ketterman uses his vast network of eyes to spy on anyone within their gaze, and if he comes across something particularly noteworthy he sells that knowledge to the highest bidder, or uses it as leverage for blackmail under his assumed alias of 'The Emerald Pool' (because his eyes are green). Ketterman has been operating for almost two decades now, and his work has traveled far across the land. Odds are his stone eyes have seen something you didn't want to be seen. So tell me friend; what are you hiding? (u/Kami-Kahzy)
        38	Blood Of Thy Enemies/Blood Of My Blood: Half the shop weapons & instruments of death run by tiny, aggressive woman. The other half a healing shop run by a large barbarian type man who's gentle. They are a couple...opposites attract? (u/YearLongSummer)

Create any additional rules, such as refund any item after purchase but at 30% of it's value, no identify spells allowed on store premises, etc. (u/YearLongSummer)

        45	Dark Arts & Melted Hearts: Your typical "Dark Arts" type store, but complete with a tavern type meeting area that regularly provides a speed dating-esque environment for undesirables, villians, & general ne'er-do-wells. Everyone deserves a shot a love right? (u/YearLongSummer)
        46	The Dock of Many Flings: A store either on the water or with a large well inside. There are no items, only shelves and shelves of pebbles worth different tiers of gold. You buy a pebble, then stand over the designated area and cast your pebble into the water. You gain a random magical effect, item, or etc. (eg. A Mini or alternate deck of many things) (u/YearLongSummer)
        47	Whispers & Secrets: The only goods bought and sold here are rumors, secrets, other generally unknown information. You cannot pay with traditional currency, must offer hidden information of your own to barter with. Use either an unbiased magical system (such as speaking your secret into a glass jar, putting the lid on placing upon a magical scale that determines it's weight/value), or for more interesting roleplaying opportunities have a totally biased shopkeep the players can haggle with or try and persuade. (u/YearLongSummer)
        48	Proctor & Son's Deadly Traps: More a small dungeon than a store, the ceiling to floor to finally the basement is covered in traps. You must survive long enough to actually disarm and then purchase your chosen traps. It used to be a family business but that didn't last for very long. (u/vetusnox)
        49	Impeccable Times: In a building stylized as a home befitting a cuckoo clock, the sound of ticking from countless mechanisms dominate the senses. The blind elderly craftsman shows no concern for anyone except his owl which is never far from his side. Secretly, he can hear from every watch and see from every clock he creates. The owl is also a mechanical contraption. (u/vetusnox)
        50	Ayesha's Insult Emporium: The store's name, in simple black lettering, is all that infers what lies inside. A friendly middle aged woman (presumably Ayesha) wearing a sari greets customers entering this store's antechamber with a sharp personal insult. Anyone who takes great offense to the insult is teleported out of the shop and can't re-enter. However, those who accept it in good spirit will be led by Ayesha to the main room which contains shelves and cabinets filled with scrolls, books and scraps of paper containing some of the most brilliant, sought-after and mind-bending insults to ever have been uttered or penned. (u/ApertureJunkieZA)
        51	The Green Room: This inn, hidden by an entrance in the sewers, provides lodging in rooms made completely of thick glass. The floors consist of different types of soil, and beds are constructed from clay with meagre hay mattresses. Patrons that stay the night develop a slight green tinge to their skin that persists for a week. For this duration, as long as one stays in direct natural sunlight for at least 4 hours a day, they need not eat. Sleep is required as usual, and water requirements per day to survive are doubled. (u/ApertureJunkieZA)
        52	The Potato Is Just An Illusion: A comedy club and tavern frequented by illusionists, diviners and enchanters. Patrons dine, drink and listen to wizards from the local guild tell comedy that is usually highly academic in nature and augmented by various creative illusions. STRICTLY NO IMP FAMILIARS ALLOWED. (u/ApertureJunkieZA)

Alethera is especially interested in the tears of adventures and famous people. (u/Patergia)
        55	Adventure's Emporium: On the outside it looks abandoned and if you ask around town you will be told it is cursed or haunted, but when adventures enter the building they enter a spacious, well lit store full of ten foot poles, iron spikes, torches, and other adventuring gear. It is run by a retired adventurer. (u/Patergia)
        56	Darvin's Dandy Dolls: A shop with shelves full of dolls, many of them resemble important political figures of the region. It is rumored that some of the dolls have power over the people they represent. (u/Patergia)

        61	Gulthric's Curiosity Shoppe: A mostly nondescript store from the outside, this shop is run by an old copper dragonborn. The inside of the shop is sectioned off with all sorts of magical items for sale, and there is the slight smell of incense. The shopkeeper will sell magic items in trade for a true story.

        Not a care in the world. This NPC is unbelievably happy. They only see the good in life and are extremely positive.

        Weirdest Mutton Chops Ever. This NPC, whether it’s a he or a she doesn’t matter, has the weirdest mutton chops anyone has ever seen. They are a different color than the rest of his/her hair and they are somehow intricately braided.
        Final Countdown. This NPC counts down after each conversation. The NPC has a conversation with the party, and when they or the NPC leave, the NPC utters: 73.

        Shaving Sucks. This NPC is very bad at shaving. If it’s a man, he has a lot of small cuts on his face. With a successful DC8 perception or insight check it’s pretty clear that they are the result of terrible shaving. If the NPC is a woman, it is almost the same, but instead the cuts are located on her legs (Yes, even in D&D some women shave their legs. Trust me!).
        Wild Accuser. This NPC accuses everyone he talks to of minor crimes, like littering, or making too much noise.
        Am I hearing this right? This NPC mishears almost everything. He/She thinks he/she heard everything right, and continues the conversation on whatever subject he/she thinks he/she heard. For example: 'Can you tell us where the Inn is?' The NPC hears: 'Can you tell us where Theon is?' And responds with: 'I have no idea who that is, I’m sorry!' If you still want the NPC to be helpful, make him/her understand every sentence correctly when he/she hears them a second time.
        Puppet Pal. This NPC always has a wooden puppet with him/her. Whatever his relationship with this puppet is, is up to you as a DM. Good luck!

        Loading, please wait. This NPC needs some time processing conversations. Whenever you talk to him/her, it takes them 1d6 + 5 full seconds to respond. Even if it’s a short and simple question.

        Lilac and Gooseberries. This NPC smells like lilac and gooseberries, a particular smell that might be familiar to some of the players.
        Mouthful. This NPC always has something in his/her mouth. It could be food… but they never swallow. And it's too big to be chewing gum. It makes this NPC very hard to understand.

        Narcissist. This NPC is always holding a mirror, looking at him or herself while blowing kisses and winking. It looks away now and then to look at the party but he or she mostly looks at themselves.
        Needlessly Shifty. This NPC comes across as very shifty. He or she laughs sneakily after answering questions or making deals, like he or she is hiding something. But they aren't, it's just a weird mannerism they were born with.
        Fungal infection. This NPC has a small growth of blue green fungus on one of their cheeks. Under close scrutiny the fungus almost seems to pulsate with every heartbeat.
        Squinter. This NPC squints their eyes at the party. It looks like he/she needs a pair of glasses.
        Mad hatter. This NPC wears a really long, really silly pointy hat. It's over 3 feet (1 meter) tall, made up of different kinds of materials and colors. Possible explanation for why the NPC is wearing it: 1. Their kid made it for them and now they are pretty much obligated to wear it. 2. They made it themselves because they believe it will make them a really powerful wizard. 3. It is a cursed hat that can't be removed and someone put it on their head while they were sleeping.
        Sketch artist. This NPC is scribbling on a piece of paper while he or she is talking to the party. After a while they proudly show the sketch they made of one of the party members. Roll 1d6/2 to see how good this NPC is. Very, very bad. Extremely average. Very, very good.
        Want a cookie? This NPC bakes their own cookies and offers to anyone and everyone to try. Roll 1d6/2 to determine the quality. Terrible, bitter and is that a hair? Average, OK cookies. These are amazing, crunchy, sweet and something you can't quite put your finger on but it's awesome.
        Juggler. This NPC is an excellent juggler and will juggle everytime he or she has two or more items in his or her hands. Their limit is 1d6 + 3 items at once.

        Phantom Cur - Cultivated from canines repeatedly revived through necromantic means, these eerie hounds outwardly seem like normal members of their species, but they often go minutes without breathing or days without blinking.

    Apocalypse
        This apocalypse will begin
            1	when the Rite of Annihilation is performed during a total planetary alignment.
            2	if the majority of living souls on the planet pray for it.
            3	when human civilization achieves the goal for which it was originally designed by entities beyond comprehension: concentrating platinum into an easily harvested form.
            4	with the first and final casting of the spell Power Word: End.
            5	when the angels of justice finally manage to argue past their deadlock with the angels of mercy for the destruction of the world.
            6	when an emperor unites all the kingdoms of the world under one crown and decrees it.
            7	when the old gods are unchained from their chthonian prison.
            8	when the Gloaming Horn is blown with enough force to topple castle walls.
            9	if the four ur-temples at the corners of the earth are desecrated.
            10	under conditions lost to mortal knowledge.
            11	if ever the gods’ supply of spilled blood and sacrifices wavers.
            12	when the last elf fades from the world.
            13	when the fruit of the Tree of Anti-Life is fed to a would-be messiah.
            14	in order to censor the spread of an ultimate cosmic secret.
            15	when an act so vile is committed that the universe rejects itself.
            16	when one of the thirty-six truly righteous people in the world is made to believe that they are what they are despite their deep humility.
            17	at the time predetermined at the world’s creation. Manipulating the golden Doomsday Clock might accelerate or delay this inevitable date.
            18	when the three pieces of the End-Bringer’s Blade are reunited.
            19	when the seal at the bottom of the Tomb of Worlds is broken.
            20	when the Questing Beast is caught and killed by an unworthy knight.
        This apocalypse is most wished to be brought about by
            1	a militant secret society of skeptics who believe it to be necessary to reveal the illusory nature of the world.
            2	a disgraced order of paladins who believe this will save the world from an oncoming eon of evil and degeneration.

            4	a genie bound to the wish of a misanthrope.
            5	an ultraterrestrial para-deity trapped within the world in a cycle of reincarnation in wretched mortal forms.
            6	an ultranationalist faction confident that they can preserve their own lands as a habitable sliver while the rest of the world is wiped away.
            7	an uncanny intelligent machine from the future, seeking to prevent its own abominable construction.
            8	the demiurge, architect of falsehood, who wishes to shape a new material reality to entrap more luminous souls.
            9	a fanatical popular movement based on a peculiar interpretation of scripture, wherein the apocalypse will result in a utopia.
            10	an infamous company of veteran mercenaries who desire an end to all conflict.
            11	a dryad-like creature bound to ferns instead of trees, who wants to deny the world usurped from them to the seeded and the flowered.
            12	a ghost who would rather see the world destroyed than move further from their treasured past.
            13	a union of overworked zeitgeists who want the turning of the ages stopped for an unmeasurable non-eon.
            14	a beloved, preternaturally-talent composer who desires the apocalypse as the coda to their greatest symphony yet.
            15	an immortal alchemist who has become terminally bored with everything.
            16	a nihilist social club.
            17	a possessing curse bound to kill all the descendants of someone who betrayed its creator tens of thousands of years ago. Most people are now descended from that someone.
            18	a necromancer who will establish a kingdom of the dead from the bones of the old world.
            19	invaders from a parallel timeline of secondary possibilities, seeking to supplant their primaries.
            20	a vengeance-crazed fallen hero who thinks it is the only way to destroy the phylactery of their nemesis, a geolich.
        An omen heralding this apocalypse
            1	is artists finding no inspiration for pleasant work, but an abundance of it for the harsh and hideous.
            2	is sterility across all kinds of animals.
            3	is the earth welling blood when dug or ploughed.
            4	is all birdsong becoming the same threnody.
            5	is the moon appearing as a glaring bloodshot eye.
            6	is the living dreaming of the dead mourning for them.
            7	is livestock being born as insatiable meat-eaters.
            8	is an autumn without end.
            9	is idols and icons spontaneously weeping black ichor.
            10	is misrule in all kingdoms.
            11	is colour dimming and darkness deepening.
            12	is the rebuilding of the True Sanctum, which will be the sole, hotly contested place untouched by the apocalypse.
            13	is fresh corpses rising to dig their own graves.
            14	is oracles and soothsayers all screaming at once before falling dead.
            15	is the birth of prodigal infants able to speak and walk from the moment of their first breath.
            16	is an endless storm of locusts scouring the land back and forth.
            17	is ploughs spontaneously reforging themselves into swords.
            18	is cities being overrun with wilderness and feral creatures.
            19	is the appearance of a comet like a bloody pennant.
            20	is a sickening miasma sweeping through the lowlands.
        When this apocalypse occurs,
            1	giants will rise from the sea and trample cities and mountains to dust.
            2	the stars will rain down, burning away the forests and the seas.
            3	the barrier between worlds will wear thin and tear, merging a corner of the multiverse into a mind-bending mosaic.
            4	light will fade from the heavens and all the world will become the larder of monsters swarming up from its shadow.
            5	an army of hollowed men will be raised, wielding weapons yet unseen to scourge the earth clean.
            6	the moon will crack as if an egg and release unclean radiance that transmutes all things exposed to it.
            7	a slow and steady plague of petrification will sweep the globe. Refugees from stone nations will hack up sand from bloody lungs, all triumphs lost to Ozymandian crumbling.
            8	complexity will flatten until only an infinite featureless plane exists. Higher thought will be one of the first things to go.
            9	things will begin to decay while still living, the only way to stave it off for a time being to devour another living thing.
            10	the world will be swallowed by a tempest. The land will be drowned by sky-high waves and vapourized beneath volleys of lightning.
            11	all water will become bitter and undrinkable, the soil will lose its goodness, and the glare of the sun will intensify until everywhere is a bleached desert.
            12	all people will become utterly atomized and alienated from each other, irrevocably separated into personal realities that can only contact each other through horrific violence.
            13	a veil will be lifted, and everything up until that point will seem to have been very silly. People will laugh themselves to death, or not bother with anything further until it all falls apart.
            14	every pantheon’s Götterdämmerung will kick off at once.
            15	the perfect cancer will metastasize, an immortal disease that assimilates all life within it.
            16	the meek shall inherit the earth, and the strong shall devour the meek’s reward.
            17	fire will spread from the world’s core, and ice from its poles. Everything will be destroyed in their collision.
            18	sense and causality will dissolve as if all the world were a dream.
            19	sorcerous ability will appear at random in people, in frequency and potency never before seen. Their magically-backed whims will tear reality asunder.
            20	the tools and machines of humanity will sprout new forms and complexities at an accelerating rate, coating first the planet and then the sun, ushering in the obsolescence of mere meat.
        In the aftermath of this apocalypse
            1	the continuity of time itself will break and turn upon itself.
            2	all will decline, crumbling over eons into the void.
            3	the few survivors will shed their lowly flesh and ascend.
            4	the world will return to primal innocence, as it was in the beginning.
            5	the lands of the living and the lands of the dead will switch their places, and ghostly throngs will feel their pulse quicken once again.
            6	the cosmos will reset to the day before it kicked off, with everyone retaining fractured memories of it.
            7	hyperdimensional vulture-analogues will pick over the wreckage.
            8	the planet will explode and fill the cosmos with its shards of new kinds of being.
            9	the dregs of the world left over will drain down to become a new layer of the Abyss.
            10	there will only be goblins left.
            11	a circle of skalds will attempt to save some part of the world by singing its stories into other realities.
            12	the world will be quarantined by the proper authorities to prevent its spread.
            13	the world’s countless ghosts and sundered futures will merge and be extruded into other worlds as destrudinous psychic sludge.
            14	most of the world will be reborn through random fluctuations in thermodynamic equilibrium many eons hence.
            15	the luckiest survivors will sail on celestial winds into the new world born from the old’s ashes.
            16	the dead world will be raised as a necrokosmos by an arch-necromancer in another universe.
            17	a new ecosystem with new peoples will emerge, adapted to the changed reality.
            18	the most interesting survivors will be put in an ultraterrestrial zoo.
            19	the world and its ending will repeat, diminished and degraded each time, as though remembered by a senile god.
            20	explorers will come from unreached elsewhere and marvel at what once was.

Setting builder
    nice book?
        who authored it?

            an outsider such as a(n)...celestial, fiend, elemental/genie, fae, or someone possessed by one.
            the culmination of the efforts of generations of scholars.
            author was taken by a eerie mood and wrote the work in a fortnight.
            it merely appeared one day, fully formed.
        
        what form does it take?
            tablets made of...stone/clay, metal, wax, wood.
            tome bound in...leather, metal, ivory, loose sheaves.
            scroll crafted of...paper, hides, leaves, cloth.
            graffiti, scrawling or runes etched onto a...structure, natural feature, path or road, cave.
            tangles of intricate ropes and beads in a language that may not still be known. may be read in the dark.
            a puzzle box or similar device. the secrets within are whispered into the mind of those who solve it.
            scrimshawed upon the bones of a(n)...humanoid, outsider, aberration, monster. may be read in the dark.
            woven into the fabric of a(n)...article of clothing, tapestry, blanket/quilt, tent/yurt
        
        what kind of lore is inside?
            the true names of...celestials, fiends, genies, fae.
            exhaustively indexed knowledge on an extremely niche topic such as elven architecture or goblin poetry. worth a small amount to most, but a huge sum to the right collector.
            a creeping form of madness which provides insight into the world. in exchange for losing one's mind permanently, the bearer of the work may ask it questions and gain answers 1d6 times per day as if they were using the spells find the path, augury, identify or clairaudience.
            a compendium covering the habits and weaknesses of...outsiders, aberrations, magical creatures, undead.
            the true and secret history of a...major empire, noble family, trade league, faith/cult.

        is it trapped or have guardians?

            lets out a blood-curdling scream and flies away at 60' turn if read anywhere except...under the stars, within a chamber with no natural light, upon unworked earth, a place of spiritual significance.
            locked. if an attempt is made to force it open it begins to weep gallons upon gallons of...blood, ink, water, ichor.
            the work is a keystone or plug of sorts, if removed or reproduced then...the area containing the work shakes itself to bits in 1d6 minutes, undead begin to appear around where the work is held, animals of all stripes become hostile to whomever bears it, bad luck follows the bearer, the referee may impose disadvantage on 1d2 rolls per day at their discretion.
            a cult or religious order is dedicated to safeguarding the work in some way. if it is stolen of copied without consent then they will surely seek to rectify the situation.
            magically bound to defend the work in some way until their destruction, the guardian takes the form of a(n)...powerful undead creature, outsider, monster, construct.
            only certain type of folk are able to read the work, it is gibberish to everyone but...non-spellcasters, followers of an obscure faith, the mad, someone who has never taken a life.
            the work itself is famous. while there is no one specifically looking for it, the very news of it changing hands may attract unwanted attention to those who now have it.

        A large list of local/common names is listed on a wall. The words "The Promise" are written above it.

        A wall hosts 7-10 or so names, crudely carved upon its surface. The names of several local town officials are listed, including the current mayor, or other form of leader. The mayor's name appears particularly jagged in style. In the centre of the names, in large letters, the phrase "The Trash Rats" is carved, with a simple image of a rat carved crudely inside of the "a" of "Trash".

        The following phrase is written on the wall in chalk: "All Guards Are Villainous"

        The following phrase is inscribed into the wall:
        "While you live, shine
        have no grief at all
        life exists only for a short while
        and Time demands his due."

        Below this, in several different carving/handwriting styles, the names of several settlements, both local and exotic, are inscribed in a list.

        The following phrase:
        "O walls, you have held up so much tedious graffiti that I am amazed that you have not already collapsed in ruin."
        Around this inscription, in several different writing styles, the words "Yes", "Agreed", or otherwise are repeated multiple times.

        A fairly neatly-drawn image of a well-endowed woman carrying two mugs of beer takes up a large portion of this wall. Below it, the phrase "Drink at the Eleven Eagles Tavern and Brewery! The beer with a raptor's heart!"

        The following words are inscribed upon a wall:
        "The light which brought peace to the darkness which surrounded me, the one who brought tranquility to the life of someone so small, has passed on, to the greatest unknown. Oh, Claire, there may be no statues in your name, no grand monuments to your beauty, but there shall be these words, scrawled upon such a place. And I hope this to be enough."*

        The following words:

        "Hells yeah, baby! Nice!"

        An image of a small, cat-like female, likely a Tabaxi, is drawn. Below it, the words "I wanna be a cat person…  :(" are written.
        Below this, in an entirely different style, the words "Hidden Treasure of Snowfall replies here. I'm not sure whether to be flattered or offended."

        On a well-travelled road, there is a commonly used campsite, with a large rock in the middle. There are dozens of pieces of graffiti inscribed upon it, some wishing luck to travellers, some of various gods of travel, some warning of the many dangers of the area, including common strategies used to avoid them. Some are simple names, indicating travelers who have come and gone before.

        On a wall, the following is inscribed:
        "SCORCH (TOWN NAME)." Such messages appear common throughout the town.

        The following words:
        "Marcus was here, and lived a life too short. Goodbye, old friend."

        The following words:
        "When I die, all these moments, these beautiful moments, will be lost. Like tears in rain."

        Carved into the wall of an out of the way alley, the following is written, underneath a list of 5 names, each written in different styles.
        "We, the Alley-cat 5, do solemnly swear that one day we will make it out of this damn town."
        Below this, there is the following quote, signed by one of the apparent members:
        "I made it, guys. I made it. Signed - (NAME)"

        The following is inscribed:
        "Go to the house of Aeneri, for a good time."

        The following words are written on the wall outside of a small fast food-style place:
        "I remark that the owner of this establishment is a scammer, and a fraud! He charges 3 copper for a watered-down beer, and his sausages were served cold!"

        The following inscription:
        "My sets of expensive copper cookery were stolen, and have not been returned to me. A reward of 10 gold will be provided to any man who catches the thief and returns my property. Speak to Tallus at the (INN/TAVERN/RESTAURANT NAME) to learn more."

        The following inscription:
        "Am I even, like, here? Sometimes, I feel numb, like everything around me doesn't even exist. What am I doing with my life? What's the point of all this?! Is this all that I'll be, for the rest of my short life?"
        Inscribed below it, there are the following words:
        "Same, man. Same."

First time offenders are warned and left with a painful burn mark, second time offenders are taken to an area of the library simply labeled 'pain room'. It's a mystery what happens in the pain room but each offender spends 20 years in it and always leave with the parts of their brain pretaining to memory removed and given back to them in a jar.

They are immune to all magical effects, including any forms of divination. If a PC asks a god or being with similar power about them, the god/other being will have no clue who they are talking about. They are friendly to the party, but will refuse to leave their cart or reveal any skin no matter what.
        The Poison Tree: The Primal Aspect of Knowledge, both good and ill. Uncovering new information is to be celebrated, even when it brings about ruin.

        Eros: Referred to as 'The Mother of Monsters' in common parlance, this entity shares its name with the later goddess of love, though Eros is far more primal. It is love and lust in all of its forms, and its offspring and faithful are hybrids of monsters and humanoid species.

The very air there is said to corrupt mortals beyond recognition, twisting them into amalgams of man and monster.

The Pig is a lawful neutral being that punishes those who try to defile the laws of nature.

When the makeshift tomb was finally unsealed, all that was found besides bones and dust was a single sea snail, dull and healthy. It MIGHT be the cerebrilith Yiith, morphed into this inconspicuous form as a disguise or a side-effect of absorbing the god's magic. Either way, the explorers that raided the ancient home knew of its history, and have taken great care to ensure that this possibly-volatile creature stays under lock and key.

        The Illumin: They are not known to engage with humans openly. But now and then, those who went spelunking or miners trapped in caves found themselves either led out by a mysterious light being. Or sometimes, led deeper in. The stories told around them are often suggestive that when someone becomes trapped in the dark, they measure a person by whether or not they bring light to others. Then choose to appear and lead them to whatever the Illumin wish them to see. Perhaps it is safety or their end. But whether or not the beings truly gauge such things or if they are each with their own whims and choices is not known to mortals. The Illumin themselves are creatures of the dark, deep, and below places. They are often compared to feyfolk or changelings but some scholars have theorized they share things in common with bioluminscent cave mushrooms or spores. They disappear in areas of light, and can shape themselves as they wish. Another more accepted theory is that they are the result of hallucinations and that they do not truly exist.

The gods knew that while they could stop his horrid new form from arising they couldn’t help but watch as the abomination unfolded before their eyes out of morbid curiosity. The forgotten king has been cursed for 500,00 years now and looks like a deformed werewolf, having one hand being larger than the other, a horn protruding from his eye socket, sickly white colored fur, and pure white eyes. The Forgotten King has never transcended into godhood for the other gods refused to allow it. He now waits in his castles ruins waiting for his daughter (who’s been dead for many many centuries) to come back from her coronation as princess (an event that happened when he was still happy).

        Asherl-Khan, The Guilt of Gods - Khan, the former god of glory, was slain and reanimated as this undead husk of a god. Khan's artifact, The Mantle of Glory was also transformed into The Mantle of Guilt which now exhales an impossibly black fog that reanimates the fallen and converts undead into following Asherl-Khan's will. The other gods were too ashamed to face their former friend and thus had Sigil's Lady of Pain seal him away in one of her mazes.

She has outlived her children, grand children, great grandchildren and so on for so many generations, but the pain of loss just doesn't seem to dissipate. This has left her a bitter old woman. She holds intimate knowledge of ancient societies because, well, she lived there and she often yearns for the 'good old days' when only sorcerers could make fire and magic couldn't be learned by any idiot who could open a book. She has attempted and failed at ending her own life and having it ended for her by provocation, but recently she has altered her strategy in life and is using her knowledge to indugle in a little necromancy.

If the Walker is spoken to politely, they will reply and offer to grant the person 'a light to watch their path'. When the person accepts, one of the lights that surround the Walker will start orbiting them instead, and will keep doing so until they die (when it flies off in a straight line, presumably back to the Walker.)

Melezabeth is mostly immobile, sitting atop of the ancient bottomless well, losing all its meals to the void beneath it. It can crawl, albeit very slowly. It can't be satiated, even with the help of its many cultists, which sacrifice countless victims to Melezabeth's all-devouring maw. Its minions suckle black goo from its disguisting arteries, like lambs of an undead goat, which gives them supernatural strength to do Melezabeth's bidding. They say the head has hypnotic abilities and when fought, it will often cannibalize its minions to instantly regenerate portions of health, catching prey with veiny tentacles and shooting nauseating goo from its swollen body.

Two elderly humans can occasionally be seen, puttering about the garden, milking the sheep, or caring for the cottage in some way. Ancient tomes and beings with such knowledge describe them simply as The Husband and The Wife, but that is largely the entirety of knowledge about them. They, or similar beings, have lived in The Cottage unchanged for millennia. The bubble in which they exist is utterly unbreachable, even by divine power or spells that effect the nature of reality itself, such as Wish. Any attempts to reach the inside of the bubble result in the breacher being hurled from the area with insane speed and force. Anyone attempting to contact the couple through the bubble will be greeted with friendly nods and waves, but no other attempts at communication.

Small and frail but radiating with power. In the light, she will answer any three questions you ask, three answers, two truths, and one falsehood.

    Warrior
        DThis warrior fights with
        a brandistock, cunningly designed so that if it is twisted just right it will shoot out its blade like an arrow.
        an arquebus with an axe-head affixed to its stock for desperate close combat.
        a broadsword and buckler. Both have seen more combat than the warrior has, and wear it in their scars.
        a steel-shod club.
        a poleaxe with a head shaped like a grinning skull.
        a pike with a gilded tip.
        a serrated scimitar.
        a morning star with its head shaped to resemble a hedgehog.
        A sabre and its scabbard, which is sturdy enough to be used as a bludgeon and parrying tool.
        a partizan adorned with bloodstained feathers.
        a brace of pistols and a pair of daggers.
        a wavy flammenschwert.
        a tower shield painted with a roaring lion, and a long flail that can strike around it.
        a composite bow. They’ve notched vulgar insults into the shafts of all their arrows.
        a spear and kite shield. The spear bears a notch for everyone it’s killed, the shield for every time it’s saved the warrior’s life.
        a halberd with a bird’s nest impaled on its point.
        a glaive elaborated decorated to resemble a wickedly thorned rose.
        a rapier and a long knife.
        a sling with lead shot, and a seax for when the enemy gets close.
        a warhammer. Its head is shaped like an anvil.
        DThis warrior fights in
        clanking old half-plate.
        a corroded coat of chains.
        iron scale-mail molded to look like a pangolin’s armour.
        treated textiles tough enough to offer some protection, dyed in abstract patterns.
        mismatched pieces of armour taken off a dozen different bodies on a dozen different battlefields.
        rattling, ill-fitted lorica segmentata.
        roughly-stitched, muddy hides from animals large and small, furry and scaly.
        a breastplate polished to a bright sheen, and poofy brocaded silk sleeves.
        plates of shell and chitin pried from the flanks of man-eating war-beasts.
        a shredded mail hauberk with arrowheads inextricably stuck in its rings.
        a burgonet, jackboots, and boiled leather.
        splinted steel vambraces and greaves, a rusty coat of plates.
        an enamelled crimson cuirass.
        barding meant for a horse, hammered out to fit them.
        lacquered lamellar.
        a cloak reinforced with light metal plates, with chains wrapped around their forearms to help parry.
        leather trousers, hobnailed boots, and woad war-paint.
        an Almain rivet with a couple missing and dented plates.
        mirror armour, its central chest disc molded to resemble an open palm.
        a brigandine coat, its cloth soiled and torn.
        This warrior fights for
        a queen long dead, a country that no longer exists.
        the ecstatic trance they enter in the heat of battle, unmatched by any other pleasure they’ve experienced.
        revenge against the whole of the world.
        just enough pay to get them high.
        the fulfilment of their unconscious deathwish, so that they may join their fallen comrades.
        the perfection of their technique, so that they may teach the next generation of warriors.
        the only god who ever answered their prayers, a bloody and rapacious thing.
        no other reason than it comes easily to them.
        the chance to stare into someone’s eyes as they die.
        an escape from the bonds of civilized society.
        an outlet for their sublimated frustrations.
        a plot of land they dream of retiring to.
        the chance to find an old enemy on the battlefield and finish their feud.
        the sake of accumulating sin to join their damned love in the hereafter.
        a fiery and uncompromising faith.
        the approval of a father no longer able to grant it.
        accolades and trophies.
        the funds to found a warrior’s paradise.
        the satiation of a curse which demands they spill ten drops of guilty blood for every drop of innocent blood they’ve taken, or else suffer unimaginably as their veins smoulder from within.
        the naked truth they believe to be revealed in life-or-death situations.
        DThis warrior stands out on the battlefield
        for their obstinate ferocity. They have never retreated from a battle without being dragged by their companions.
        for their blood-curdling war-shouts.
        for their calm and clear sight even in the thickest fog of war.
        for the elegant execution of their enemies.
        for the technical precision of their fighting.
        for their graceful, dance-like movements.
        for their unpredictable speed.
        for their brutal strength.
        for their numb resistance to pain and wounds.
        for their disrespect to fallen opponents.
        because they seek out the strongest-seeming foes to fight.
        because of their towering height and abnormal reach.
        for the nigh-impassable wall that is their guard.
        for their opportunistic hit-and-run tactics.
        for their impeccable observation of proper battlefield decorum, and fair treatment of prisoners.
        for the way their charismatic presence lends their fellows courage.
        because of the sweet scent of the perfume they douse themself with before every battle.
        for the way they can predict their opponents and plan ten moves in advance.
        for the sheer dumb luck they must have to survive their own clumsiness.
        for their dirty tricks and unflappable wit.
        DWhen this warrior cries out in their sleep they are reliving
        the moment they squandered an entire campaign’s worth of pay on an ill-advised gamble.
        the beatings they suffered at the hands of their mentor.
        when they had to hide among the reeking dead and were trampled beneath them all the same.
        a duel they lost by their overconfidence, and survived only due to cowardice.
        a campaign they marched for so long they forgot the smell of home.
        a rout so total that more were killed by the weight of their fleeing comrades than were on the blades of the enemy.
        a combat fought in tunnels so close you couldn’t swing a sword.
        a battle fought within fading firelight, those at the sputtering edge picked off by blind enemies.
        an ambush when they were caught wading waist-deep through mud.
        a terrible trip they suffered because of the hallucinogenic venom smeared along an enemy’s weapon.
        the moment they realized they were going to live and die by the sword.
        a fight against a monster no mortal weapons could scratch.
        the moment they received a wound whose scar still aches even all these years later.
        the turning point of a battle when those they thought were steadfast allies betrayed them.
        a time they thought they’d found peace fell into chaos once more.
        the loss of their dear love while they were away on campaign.
        the long sickness that wasted away their hard-earned strength.
        the civil schism that turned them against their brother.
        when a priest cursed the warrior with their last breath.
        the moment they sold out their comrades who planned to desert their army.

Fiend Contract fine print
    The signatory has to carry a device that pulls energy from them, charging it. It radiates with heat (not damaging) and glows red at night or when demihumans are near.

    The signatory must become the hive for a nest of dire hornets.

    The signatory must throw 25% of all gold they earn into the sea (or appropriate way to lose it based on the contract). If they gain items for any reason, the 25% of the item can be taken as a substitute tax.

    Two nights a week, the signatory is not allowed to sleep. The sleep they would get is transferred to an unnamed slumbering creature that requires a set amount of slumber before awakening. The signatory gains a level of exhaustion after each of these nights.

    Everyone forgets an event in which the signatory participated.

    From now on, another creature will take all the credit for the signatory's deeds.

    The signatory must babysit the contract-holder’s nephew. Any damage sustained to the child will be dealt to them with a 5 second delay (the next combat round). Healing, unfortunately, does not transfer in the same way.

    The contract specifies that the signatory must break a fellow demon out of a prison in heaven within the next 30 days. Failure to bring the demon home and in stable, living condition means the demon can possess the signatory's body and use it as a vessel.

    The signatory signs over the rights to all of their teeth, and all future teeth they may acquire through any means.

    The signatory agrees that at any time they can be teleported to the contract owner's location and provide a foot massage. The massage will not last longer than 10 minutes.

    At any time, any place, under any circumstance, the fiend may plane shift the signatory to their home plane for one minute, as a workplace-exchange program sponsored by the fiend’s superiors. A fiend of similar power to the signatory replaces the signatory for the time period. Per the conditions of the contract, any such interplanar travel is voluntary for the signatory, and cannot be resisted.

    The signatory owes a tithe of blood each day. Signatory takes 1d4 damage at dusk each day. Any class features or magic used to prevent the damage will void the contract, and the fiend will be free to go.

    At the start of any combat, the signatory must make a DC13 Wisdom save or be frightened of the enemy combatants for 1 minute. The signatory can make another save at the beginning of their turn each round to resist the effect.

    The fiend will assist the signatory in combat, but only attacks when the signatory takes damage.

    The fiend narrates the signatory's every move, providing inner monologues as well. The narration is not necessarily true. Signatory has disadvantage on stealth and deception checks.

    The signatory's mundane weapons become enchanted, acting as magical weapons. However, only the fiend may wield them on their behalf. The signatory or their companions cannot use them.

    Other fiends regularly appear to the signatory, urging them to sign their own contracts. Apparently, the signatory's agreeable nature is attractive to fiends…

    All other contracts previously signed by the signatory are now null and void. House deeds, bank accounts, and loan debt are all lost, though a warlock pact is strong enough to resist this nullification.

    The signatory's left and right hands completely swap. This doesn’t have much of a mechanical effect, but some might think they are a Rakshasa.

    The signatory and their nearest sibling switch names. (If they are an only child, swap names with mother or father). 

    Minor spouts of what some would call “stage magic” happen involuntarily. Each time the signatory fails a Constitution saving throw, roll on the table below (1d6) (or DM’s choice) to see what happens.
    A crow flies out of their mouth (50% chance to be dead and skeletal)

    Their footprints glow with iridescent paint for one hour.

    Their head falls off, and they must use their reaction to catch it. If they do not have a reaction remaining, take 1d12 necrotic damage.

    All of their bones crack, dealing 1d8 thunder damage to you and half as much to any creature within 5 feet.

    Invisible three-quarters cover appears between them and the 5-foot space in front of them.

    All the currency in their pockets appears in their hand. If you do not have a free hand, it falls at their feet.

    Whenever signing further contracts, the signatory must ask to be paid in slaves, in addition to or instead of any other reward. When a sufficient number of slaves is reached, a fiend will arrive to take them away and the contract will be fulfilled.  

    The signatory must fully abstain from (insert their favorite food, drink, or substance).

    Each time the signatory get a full night's rest, they take on the appearance of someone else.

    At any point, the fiend may take control of the signatory's body. Having signed, the victim may get a saving throw, but passing it would be a breach of contract. For one day, the fiend has complete control of the body. The signatory is in the equivalent of a deep coma. Usually there may be additional clauses, limiting what the fiend is allowed to do, e.g.: can't harm the body, or make it do clearly suicidal things, or directly attack the signatory's allies, but is otherwise free to use it as they please. 

    The signatory isn’t allowed to enter any type of contract, alliance or agreement with good-aligned churches or entities, without the explicit permission of the fiend. 

    A clone of the signatory will appear. The original and the clone will both be convinced they are the real one, with the same ability and memories, and only high-level magic will be able to tell them apart. 

    The signatory loses the ability to read.

    The signatory permanently loses one or more of the following senses: smell, hearing, touch, taste, the ability to perceive temperature, the ability to feel pain, the ability to keep rhythm. 

    When the time comes where the signatory can vote, their vote will be determined by the contract owner.

    The signatory loses the ability to deceive. The signatory can lie, or omit the truth, but the contract holder will correct them and notify the other party of the lie.

    They inexplicably become obsessed with a new hobby. The need to explore this hobby is as compelling as their previously favorite activity.

    The signatory is now betrothed to a family member of the contract holder (a fiend, of course). In 90 days, planar immigration authorities will give the signatory and their betrothed a test to show they are indeed in love and know enough about each other. If either person fails the test, they will both be banished from this plane. If they succeed, the wedding will take place within 24 hours. Failure to show up to the wedding or refuse the marriage will result in banishment as well.

    The signatory will be transported to the contract owner’s position in the event the contract owner is threatened.

    The signatory gives up their fertility and any other means of producing an offspring.

    The signatory must house a sentient parasite for one year. If the parasite does not survive, a new one will arrive and the year starts over.

    The signatory must listen to the contract owner’s nephew/niece’s band play their first show. This includes cheering when songs end, buying merch, and congratulating the band after finishing the show but before leaving the venue.

    The signatory must plan and execute an amazing surprise birthday party for an entity/person/creature/or other specified consciousness or concept of the contract owner’s choosing.

    The signatory must replace one of their eyes with the contract owner’s eyes (contract owner’s choice of which eyes). Both parties will be able to see through the replacement eye.

    The signatory must convince the contract owner’s parent said parent is wrong about a particular issue of the contract owner’s choice. 

    The signatory must act irrationally towards certain people or groups of people, chosen beforehand. The signatory is required to act foolishly, be very annoying or hectic, and never explain their action to anybody. 

    The signatory must wear a necklace of severed fingers, and isn’t allowed to hide it under clothes or conceal it in any way.

    The signatory must pay for 10 guards to comprise the contract holder's bodyguard. These count as elite troops or skilled labor for purposes of daily wages (ex. 3g/day/person, in 5e DMG terms).

    After the term of contract is up, the signatory must serve the contract holder as a dually bonded mercenary for the same term of time. The fiend will very likely employ the signatory as a bodyguard, or as a line troop in the Blood War.

    The contract holder must receive one good-aligned sacrifice every new moon, or quarter, if the world has no moons. If an evil-aligned creature is sacrificed instead, the contract holder becomes beholden to the sacrificial creature. If the sacrifice is forgotten or otherwise missed, the contract is void, and the contract holder attacks the signatory in an attempt to kill and steal their soul.

    The signatory must open a gate to the contract holder's home plane within a year and a day of signing the contract.

    The signatory must betray the trust of someone they love. This must happen during the period of the contract.

    The signatory must intentionally lose a public fight against the contract holder, at a time and location chosen by the contract holder. The signatory must put up a believable and convincing act.

    Any healing magic cast upon the signatory is now split with the contract holder, with half of the HP value going to each. Any regeneration from items is also split between them. Resurrection or restoration magic works as normal. This effect lasts through the duration of the contract.

    The signatory begins to gain weight inexplicably. Nine months to the day after signing, the signatory gives birth to the contract holder's spawn. This happens regardless of the signatory's gender. The signatory loses half their HP, and gains three levels of exhaustion during the ordeal.
