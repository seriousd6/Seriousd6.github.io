        A floating chest that when anything is removed from it creates a inescapable barrier around it that only goes away if the item taken, or something of equal or higher value is placed back in the chest. 
        A mirror that shows a parallel dimension version of whomever looks into it, with slight to large differences being shown. 
        A skull that can speak and remembers it's former life, but can do nothing else. 
        An enchanted broom that cleans on its own, but also has a personality of a disgruntled dog. 
        A working spirit board, that allows limited communication with whatever spirits may be near. 
        A magical vending machine that when a gold is deposited, it creates and gives a 3' wood statue of who ever is standing in front of it. 
        Giant ceramic jars with holes in them for air, and a trickle of water. The jars are the size of houses and magically sedate (and then force into hibernation and then stasis) anyone who enters them in short order. They are a form of larder for keeping sentient creatures alive and fat until thier time to be eaten. 
        A crown that puts the wearer to sleep, but then transforms the world around them into a twisted version of what they are dreaming. The dream ends if the crown is removed. The more powerful lucid dreamers can even interact and live in this dream world, which grows larger the more powerful they are. 
        A porthole of desire. There's some standing stone, with a hole carved out through to the otherside. It shows the observer the greatest desire of a person they are observing through the porthole, examples include a spider subject where everything is covered in webs, and dog and their owner playing together, or an ork burning down the world. 
        A prayer wheel assembly with a near infinite number of runes in an ancient and pre-verbal form of celestial. With it, one might spend a 5th level spell slot and gain a use of a spell similar to Commune with a deity that is within 1 step of the caster's alignment. They may ask up to 8 questions, but the DM must SECRETLY flip a coin each question up to a maximum of 2d4-1 times (max once each question). On tails, the answer she gives must be False or a Lie. If Heads, instead the answer must be True, if cryptic. After the 2d4-1 confusions have occured, then the resulting answers must be True. Using the device more than once per day requires a DC15 Wisdom save, or the user takes a point of exhaustion. 
        An eternally screaming fire skull. It’s not in pain or anything, just bored. Giving it something that might distract it might stop the screaming. 
        A black stone statue of a frog filling a cubic foot, weighing 150 lbs. Expend a spell slot of at least level one. Every flying insect, bug, creepy crawly, and flying vermin of size Tiny or smaller within a 40 foot cube centered on the frog is snatched by shadowy lashing tongues of force. After 1 hour, roll a d6. On a 5 or higher, the item creates 1d3 goodberries. The statue continue snatching insects for 1d4 hours after activation, a higher level spell slot multiplies the duration. Roll again for goodberries after each hour. The frog is capable of attacking swarms as well, dealing 1d6 hp worth of damage to the swarm or single Tiny flying creature within its range of effect every round, for the duration. 
        Orb of Distant Sight: A crystal sphere the size of a basketball, weighing 50 pounds. Spend a 1st level spell slot, and an image of anything located within a 40 foot cube (within line of sight of the orb, and within a maximum range of thirty miles, or the horizon, whichever is closer) is shown, projected within a 10 foot cube adjacent to the orb, as per the spell Silent Image. The image updates in real time. Using a full round action, the area spied upon may be moved up to 40 feet per round, within range, and the Orb's effect lasts for 1d10 minutes. Spending a higher level spell slot multiplies the duration of effect. Additionally, once per day, spend a Level 1 spell slot, and the Orb may be used to project an image in the reverse manner to a point within the same range, as per the spell Silent Image for 1d10 rounds. Higher level spell slots multiply the duratiom of this effect. Using the orb in this manner prevents its use for any other purpose for a full 8 hours. 
        Altar of Imbuement: A smoked boxwood altar three feet to a side, with fine ivory handles wrapped in gold wire and decorated with cabochons of Onyx and Amber. A fine golden chalice is mounted inside the altar. Place a magical item that has at least 1 charge remaining, expend a divine spell slot of at least level 1, and pray for 8 hours; roll a d6, on a 5 or higher the item will regain 1 charge (up to a maximum of 3 charges in a 1 month period, or 6 charges per year, whichever happens sooner). Spending a higher level spell slot reduces the required d6 roll, becoming automatic when a 6th level divine spell is expended. 
        The Burning Bell: A courtroom with a sinister looking, large-sized black-iron bell (with no clapper) with adamantine bands is mounted six feet above the floor in a central position. The bell weighs over 200,000 pounds and is twenty feet tall and ten feet across at the base. When rung, it peals at B♭-1 (14.5 Hz) and can be heard for up to 10 miles. While painfully loud, a strange property of the amphitheater is that it protects those inside it from the bulk of hearing damage from the bell's peal. A marble dais is built directly beneath the bell, while a second (more ornately carved) is nearby. The sound of the bell is almost completely muted while standing on either dias. The courtroom is shaped like an amphitheater, with rising levels of seating behind the second dias. The bell (and surrounding temple courtroom) is covered with bas-releif pictoglyphs in a forgotten tongue, the glyphs demonstrate a man standing burning beneath the bell, while those surrounding fall to thier knees. Spend a spell slot of at least third level, and the bell peals, sustaining itself for 3d6 minutes, a higher level spellslot multiplies the length of this effect. While active, anyone hearing the bell (including those on the dais) is under the effects of the spell Zone of Truth. Attempting to lie causes physical pain (and potentially damage) that increases to a maximum beneath the bell. Within the first d6 minutes, the Will DC beneath the bell is equal to the 16+caster's proficiency bonus. This decreases by 1 for every d6 minutes or 100 feet of distance (to a minimum of DC10). Those who lie while beneath the bell suffer 3d6 Sonic damage and 3d6 fire damage (reduced by 1d6 for every 10 feet of distance or d6 minutes, to a minimum of 2 sonic and 2 fire). They may attempt a CON save equal to the same DC (as to lie) to only suffer half damage. 
        Goblets of Shattering: A set of at least seven fragile musical crystal goblets. Up to once per hour, when all are played at once, it casts the spell Shatter against targets within range. Roll a d6. On a 1, this causes one of the goblets to break as well, but the damage dealt is doubled. If all the goblets are broken, the magical set no longer functions. 
        The Whispering Pillars: A set of 60 foot tall pillars, intricately carved. Anyone seated at the top of a pillar suffer the following effects (during) and up to 1d6 hours after leaving: Blinded (CON DC15 resist), Silence (WILL DC15 resist), and Slow (DEX DC15 resist). While seated at the top of the pillar, the creature gains ADV on sound based Perception checks and a +5 bonus, being able to hear even a whisper up to ten miles away, as if they were right next to the whisperer. Additionally, once per eight hours, the listener may use the effect of the spell Detect Thoughts against one creature they perceive within 1d6 miles. 
        A heavy gold plated metal washtub weighing 300 pounds. Six feet long, three feet across and three feet deep. When mostly filled with clean warm water, any object or creature placed within the tub is cleansed as per the spell Prestidigitation. It also smells strongly of either rosewater, jasmine, orange blossom, mint, smoked sausage/bacon/steak, sandalwood, patchouli, or lavender (roll a d8), for up to one hour. 
        A Giant Pendulum in a Garguantuan Grandfather Clock: Movement speed in the room is doubled, but all creatures in the room are under the effects of Slow (Will DC 15, resist at start of each round) or Haste (Will DC 15, resist at start of round), determined by a coinflip for each creature upon entering the area, or at the start of thier turn. 
        A fancy room with a very accurate dollhouse inside that creates dolls of anyone or anything within 100 feet. Interacting with the dolls or furniture moves and affects their counterparts as well, and againstvliving creatures the effect is like that of a Voodoo doll (Will/Str/Con DC 15 to resist at the start of the round. Resist three rounds and you are immune to the effect until your next long rest.) Each round, the contents of the house reflect reality. Damaging or destroying the dollhouse deals an equal amount of damage to all within range.

    mystic grimoires
        This grimoire
        is bound with a cover made from human teeth and nails.
        was inked with the discoloured blood of inhuman beasts.
        is a mere fragment of a greater work, all that could be preserved from a purge.
        is, or has become, a living creature. Its pages pulse with a faint heartbeat, and absorb unwary worms for sustenance.
        has synaesthetic text, words that are smelled or felt more than read.
        changes its exact wording each time it’s read.
        always appears in the dreams of those who’ve read it before, where it remains perfectly legible.
        will pluck at the strings of fate to place itself in the possession of ambitious sorts if it’s sealed away for too long.
        is a glass puzzlebox which projects its text when a light is shone through it. Rearranging it reveals another segment of text.
        has increasingly deranged marginalia scribbled in a dozen different hands in its open spaces.
        makes you speak its words aloud as you read it, someone else’s voice coming from your throat.
        appears to be written in gibberish until you add your signature to the many that fill its otherwise blank front page.
        glows with a sickly light, so that it is legible even in total darkness.
        seems fated to injure its readers. One can scarcely turn a page without getting a papercut.
        has a section of actual human spine as its spine.
        is fireproof, and can only be read in full by immolating it.
        causes its reader’s eyes to bleed. Reading it too much inflicts blindness, as readers become unable to see anything but the grimoire.
        is a stack of clay tablets. There’s more tablets in the stack than it seems there should be based on its size and weight, and any tablets removed or destroyed inexplicably return to the stack.
        heals any damage done to it, leaving a mottled scar.
        is written in a code that takes sustained effort to crack. Without this effort, it seems to be a mundane cookbook.
        DThis grimoire was written
        by a doomed poet who dove deep into a mystery cult for inspiration.
        by a scholar who claimed to have tapped into the Akashic Records, where all knowledge is stored.
        by a popular medium while in a trance, shortly before their mysterious disappearance.
        by a priest who became obsessed with dubious apocrypha.
        by an unknown authour. It simply appeared in history one day.
        by an entire village, one page to a person, before they walked together into the night, never to be seen again.
        by a thousand deranged monkeys.
        by the head doctor of an asylum, based on the rantings of their patients.
        by the hands of an infamous thief, after they were cut off as punishment.
        by a historian based on their collated research on several lost civilizations.
        by a child who claimed to have been inspired by their imaginary friend.
        some time in the future. What you might find of it now is an imperfect, backwards copy anticipating its own original.
        shamefully, by a secret heresiarch.
        apparently long before any other example of written language.
        by a self-proclaimed prophet who claimed to have received its text in a god-granted vision.
        by a hermit best known for throwing their feces at visitors.
        by a jaded noble who brought ruin to their estate in pursuit of limit-experiences.
        by a professor and their closest students, who barricaded their university and slaughtered the rest of the inhabitants.
        as a bowdlerization of a yet more dreadful tome.
        by the hands of the true creator of the world, allegedly.
        DThe lore which this grimoire contains
        is rituals to summon demons, though not to control or banish them.
        is how to mix potions which induce mutation.
        is the secret names of angels, which allow them to be bound against their will.
        is the location of a dormant undead army and the means to command it.
        is how to open portals to inchoate realms beyond the conventional cosmos.
        is knowledge of how to enslave human souls to animate fell golems.
        is rituals to transform oneself into a kind of intelligent undead: a vampire, a ghoul, a lich, and stranger sorts besides.
        is a tragically flawed ritual to resurrect the dead.
        is spells to cook together living things into hybrid monsters.
        is rites to commune with a banished and vengeful divinity.
        is a rite to shuck one’s own dooms, curses, and misfortunes onto a more innocent scapegoat.
        describes how to slip one’s soul away from just punishment in the hereafter, or damn another to far worse than they deserve.
        is rituals to transfer your mind into another’s body, consuming their self in the process, or to splinter off pieces of your mind to fester and infect another’s.
        is how to call up plagues, but not how to cure them.
        is the method to create a sphere of annihilation.
        can be used to immanentize the eschaton.
        is knowledge of how to remove human organs and replace them with empowering alien substitutes.
        is how to steal life-force from others to enhance and extend one’s own.
        is charms to bend the minds of others.
        is how to steal and pervert divine magic.
        DThis grimoire was forbidden
        so that its temptation to prospective seekers would be increased.
        not for the lore it contained, but rather for its satirical preface which offended a political leader.
        because hidden in its text is a memetic weapon that drives readers mad.
        because its cover forms a seal that unleashes a malign spirit while it is open.
        because it’s a failed attempt at a phylactery, and so its writer(s)’s ghost(s) can haunt anyone who’s read it.
        because it was used to facilitate an atrocity.
        due to the blasphemous ideas its text promulgates.
        because none of its lore is accurate, and is in fact a trick for an even darker purpose.
        because reading it is a spiritual hazard that dooms one’s soul to a truly unfortunate afterlife.
        because it’s proof of the limits of safe, sane magic.
        because of the machinations of a sorcerer who thought it plagiarized their own work.
        because it was once the key element in a plot to hasten the apocalypse.
        because the lore it contains could destabilize the natural order of things.
        because prophecy held that great evil would follow if it were not kept out of sight of perusing eyes.
        because the gods have a habit of smiting indiscriminately around it.
        by a tyrant who didn’t want anyone else to be able to tap its power.
        due to popular demand.
        because as it’s read it refines and expands on itself by reading in turn the minds of its readers.
        because the publishing house that owns the rights to it gets violently litigious if there’s any chance it might be copied.
        as an excuse to seize it for an authority’s use.
        DThis grimoire might be found
        locked up in the archives of a scholastic monastery.
        in the hoard of a dragon who gathers knowledge rather than gold.
        in a parasitic, paradimensional library that siphons the collection and readers of other libraries.
        in the study of a libertine aristocrat.
        as the centrepiece of a mystery cult.
        in a sealed chest in a mermaid’s sea-cave, looted from a shipwreck.
        chained to the wrist of a cenobite-censor.
        within the wooden shell of a filing-golem.
        in the possession of a cult transcribing it onto woodblocks for printing and widespread distribution.
        through a map encoded in an occultist’s notes.
        clutched in a dead wizard’s desiccated claws.
        in the lab of a researcher trying to extract insights palatable to conventional magical practice.
        in a revolutionary’s hideout, as a weapon of last resort.
        as the heirloom of a clan of backwoods hedge-witches.
        in a tower on a barren island, its garrison all dead of simultaneous suicide.
        sorted among mundane codexes by a senile bureaucrat.
        locked in a safe in an inquisitor’s office.
        in the possession of an orphan being groomed by a loose familiar to become an obedient archmage.
        in a decrepit sanctum, guarded by a vampire awaiting the return of their master’s reincarnation to claim it.
        in the ash-piles of a failed book burning.

        Pockmarks. This NPC has his/her face covered in the permanent impression that the pocks left.

        Shoes switched. This NPC always puts his/her shoes on the wrong feet.

        Ugly. This NPC is incredibly ugly, and the party needs to do a constitution saving throw of DC 10, or they’ll puke.

        Peg-leg. This NPC has one wooden leg, just like the classic pirate captains used to have.
        Missing eyebrows. This NPC has no eyebrows. It’s really difficult to see what kind of expression he or she is making, therefore players have disadvantage on wisdom (Insight) checks concerning this NPC.
        Musical Madness. This NPC likes to sing his/her way through life. Everybody kind of hates it, but the high notes hang around like flies when this NPC is singing (which he/she does instead of talking).
        Scared of Little People. This NPC somehow is extremely scared of halflings, gnomes and dwarves. He/She could very well be one of those races him/herself, but they’ll only hang around with larger people. Why this NPC feels this way, I’m not sure. Maybe you know?
        Joker of the Town. This NPC thinks he/she is the funniest of the town/city. He/She always makes the most terrible jokes and always ends them with: 'Haha, I’m joking of course.'
        I wanted to be a ballerina. This NPC dislikes whatever occupation it has now. He/She always wanted to be a dancer but never had the chance. He/She is actually pretty good at will dance during conversations with the party if possible.

        Natural Born Trader. This NPC tries to sell you everything it can. 'See this chair? It’s yours for just two gold pieces! See this flower? Yours for a piece of silver, it’s really rare! See my wife/husband? It’s yours for…'
        Not a care in the world. This NPC is unbelievably happy. They only see the good in life and are extremely positive.
        Higher than thou. This NPC feels like the fucking king/queen of the country. They talk down to almost everyone and use a (what they think is) a royal way of speaking.

        What’s this for? This NPC doesn’t use his left arm. He/She just leaves it hanging, doing nothing. There’s nothing wrong with the arm, the NPC just doesn’t use it at all. For nothing.
        Classic Tammy. This NPC has underwear visible above his or her pants. It’s not that his/her pants are really low, but his/her underwear is just really high. Roll a d4 to determine the state of the underwear, Clean, nothing special, Dirty and torn, Obviously way too tight, Very sexy.
        First off: nonsense. This NPC starts every new sentence with one of the following d6 random words (or one you come up with yourself of course); Dangerzone, Beelzebub, Calipers, Possessed, Desire, Synergy.
        Genderswap. This NPC likes to cross dress. Everytime the party leaves and sees this NPC again, they switched clothing and makeup to the other gender.
        Weirdest Mutton Chops Ever. This NPC, whether it’s a he or a she doesn’t matter, has the weirdest mutton chops anyone has ever seen. They are a different color than the rest of his/her hair and they are somehow intricately braided.
        Final Countdown. This NPC counts down after each conversation. The NPC has a conversation with the party, and when they or the NPC leave, the NPC utters: 73. When the party then asks: 'What was that?' The NPC will claim to not know what they are talking about, then leaves again saying: 72. Good luck roleplaying this one.
        Grumpy face. This NPC has a face that says: 'I hate everything. I hate hating everything.' Basically, his or her face looks incredibly pissed off all the time, even though he or she might be very happy.
        Poker face. This NPC has a poker face. It’s nearly impossible to discern any emotions, all insight checks on this NPC need to be made with disadvantage.
        To be or not to be. This NPC is desperately trying to become an actor/actress. He/She is not very good at it though. In normal conversations this NPC sounds like he or she is talking on stage, it sounds very fake and extremely articulated.
        Lip Licker. This NPC licks his lips, a lot. I mean really, this NPC licks his or her lips constantly. It’s extremely unsettling.
        Shaving Sucks. This NPC is very bad at shaving. If it’s a man, he has a lot of small cuts on his face. With a successful DC8 perception or insight check it’s pretty clear that they are the result of terrible shaving. If the NPC is a woman, it is almost the same, but instead the cuts are located on her legs (Yes, even in D&D some women shave their legs. Trust me!).
        Wild Accuser. This NPC accuses everyone he talks to of minor crimes, like littering, or making too much noise.
        Am I hearing this right? This NPC mishears almost everything. He/She thinks he/she heard everything right, and continues the conversation on whatever subject he/she thinks he/she heard. For example: 'Can you tell us where the Inn is?' The NPC hears: 'Can you tell us where Theon is?' And responds with: 'I have no idea who that is, I’m sorry!' If you still want the NPC to be helpful, make him/her understand every sentence correctly when he/she hears them a second time.
        Puppet Pal. This NPC always has a wooden puppet with him/her. Whatever his relationship with this puppet is, is up to you as a DM. Good luck!
        Bless you! This NPC has a permanent cold. Always a runny nose and sneezing all the time.

        Permanent Ink. This NPC has a large tattoo of an animal’s head on their neck. If you can’t think of an animal yourself then it’s a chicken’s head.
        Loading, please wait. This NPC needs some time processing conversations. Whenever you talk to him/her, it takes them 1d6 + 5 full seconds to respond. Even if it’s a short and simple question.
        Whispering guide. This NPC has a small creature hidden in their hair that whispers advice and insight into their ear. The creature is a Sprite, which has the ability to turn invisible and sense if anyone is lying by touching them.
        My brother, there art thou! This NPC is convinced that one of the party members is their long lost brother or sister. He or she will not be easily convinced of the contrary.
        Shapeshifter. This NPC is actually a doppler. The players might notice subtle changes in the NPC’s physical attributes each subsequent visit, like a smaller nose, another eye colour or an extra feet in height.
        Lilac and Gooseberries. This NPC smells like lilac and gooseberries, a particular smell that might be familiar to some of the players.
        Mouthful. This NPC always has something in his/her mouth. It could be food… but they never swallow. And it's too big to be chewing gum. It makes this NPC very hard to understand.
        The Narrator. This NPC always speaks about him or herself in the third person, and he or she narrates everything that happens in their vicinity.
        Narcissist. This NPC is always holding a mirror, looking at him or herself while blowing kisses and winking. It looks away now and then to look at the party but he or she mostly looks at themselves.
        Needlessly Shifty. This NPC comes across as very shifty. He or she laughs sneakily after answering questions or making deals, like he or she is hiding something. But they aren't, it's just a weird mannerism they were born with.
        Fungal infection. This NPC has a small growth of blue green fungus on one of their cheeks. Under close scrutiny the fungus almost seems to pulsate with every heartbeat.
        Squinter. This NPC squints their eyes at the party. It looks like he/she needs a pair of glasses.
        Mad hatter. This NPC wears a really long, really silly pointy hat. It's over 3 feet (1 meter) tall, made up of different kinds of materials and colors. Possible explanation for why the NPC is wearing it: 1. Their kid made it for them and now they are pretty much obligated to wear it. 2. They made it themselves because they believe it will make them a really powerful wizard. 3. It is a cursed hat that can't be removed and someone put it on their head while they were sleeping.
        Sketch artist. This NPC is scribbling on a piece of paper while he or she is talking to the party. After a while they proudly show the sketch they made of one of the party members. Roll 1d6/2 to see how good this NPC is. Very, very bad. Extremely average. Very, very good.
        Want a cookie? This NPC bakes their own cookies and offers to anyone and everyone to try. Roll 1d6/2 to determine the quality. Terrible, bitter and is that a hair? Average, OK cookies. These are amazing, crunchy, sweet and something you can't quite put your finger on but it's awesome.
        Juggler. This NPC is an excellent juggler and will juggle everytime he or she has two or more items in his or her hands. Their limit is 1d6 + 3 items at once.
    doggos
        Volmusian Ember Hair - A breed derived from fire elemental stock, bred by druids as attack animals. Fiery red hair, maned, with a sturdy frame and short snout. 1d3 Fire damage/round if within 5ft and the dog dislikes you.
        Mutt of Tindalos - Possessed of the blood of creatures which exist outside of space-time; this canine does not move, it simply stutters & teleports up to 40ft in a round instead. They are off-putting creatures, emaciated and long-limbed with greenish-grey fur.
        Hemohound - Descended from the hounds owned by vampires. Sable-furred, with crimson eyes and bodies built for pursuit. Hemohounds feed on blood, and biting living creatures heals them. Each successful bite restores 1 HP to the dog.
        Cerberusid - Smuggled out from Hades itself, these stocky, well-muscled and snub nosed dogs have multiple heads for observing the comings and goings of the dead. Advantage on anything to do with multi-tasking or perception. Roll 1d6 - 1-3: 2 heads, 4-6: 3 heads.
        Dorician Pale Dog - Developed by fakirs for the purposes of curing diseases, these wane and mangy beasts are capable of taking diseases into themselves by licking the afflicted and transferring them to another through the means of coughing or sneezing fits.
        Dolchean Mole-hound - A strange breed of canine developed by dwarves to help them guard their subterranean farms. Mole-hounds have short white fur, huge reflective eyes, and massive paws. These dogs can burrow and dig at half the speed at which they can run.
        Sivardian Chaser - These huge, grey-furred, and wolf like dogs were bred by Hobgoblins to keep pace with and flush out their traditional Centaur rivals. Chasers move 20ft faster a round than a typical canine.
        Phantom Cur - Cultivated from canines repeatedly revived through necromantic means, these eerie hounds outwardly seem like normal members of their species, but they often go minutes without breathing or days without blinking. Their own proximity to death allows them to sense and affect incorporeal beings.
        Spell Terrier - Developed by generations of spell-casters to be the ideal Familiar, spell terriers are small enough to be carried on one's person and are possessed of luxurious hair suitable for petting. Spell Terriers can identify and retrieve spell components and magical items.
        Witcher Spaniel - A dog bred by mage-hunters to help them identify their targets. These spaniels are tall and long-bodied, with short dark coats and pointed features. Witchers can sense the presence of magic, and will growl when a spell is used in their presence.

        Splay-toed Goblin Dog - Long of limb and short-furred with large digit pads, these dogs are used by Goblins as both draft and riding animals. Their feet allow them to easily bound and scurry up the broken terrain and caves in which their masters make their homes. Splay-toes ignore the effects of difficult terrain and climb half as their movement speed.
        Chardonian Water Spaniel - Savior of pirates and sailors the world over, Chardonian are mid-sized short-haired dogs which come in a variety of blues. Fiercely loyal, these dogs are trained to retrieve folk thrown overboard during sea voyages. Chardonian have been interbred with water elementals, and they may breathe underwater and swim as quickly as they run.
        Drowish Oozehound - Bizarre and terrifying creatures designed by the dark elves as guardians for their slave pens. These beasts tend towards bright and playful personalities, their fur replaced by semi-translucent globules of tar like ichor. A bite (or nuzzle) from an Oozehound necessitates a strength check to escape.
        Saoghal Cultivated Dog - A servant dog bred by the nobility to be a gentleman's best friend, these beautiful beasts move with the poise and elegance of an aristocrat. Their long fur is kinked into tight spools which must be brushed daily to keep from knotting. Saoghals are incredibly intelligent, watching those that treat with their owners carefully, barking or growling when they suspect that lies are being told.
        Doppeldachshund - Originally the product of a now obscure and likely mad arch-mage, this breed of dog is now chiefly treasured by cheap side shows and thieves. Doppeldachshund are able to briefly alter their form into that of other animals of their own approximate size. They can maintain an alternate form for only ten minutes before shifting back.
        Corantinian War Dog - Chosen from the fiercest and largest stock by generations of crusaders to foster a gargantuan canine which rivals a small pony in size. Corantinians have thick coats of white fur which braid themselves into thick protective cords as the dog matures. Corantinians have an extra Hit Die than a typical canine.
        Troll-blooded Laika - This particular land race was developed by goblinoid tribes to aid them in their hunts and raids. Interbred with regenerating creatures, these dogs are utterly fearless and unflinchingly loyal. They are a mid-sized breed and of average build, but they are terribly ugly, covered in patches of uneven and wart-ridden fur. Troll-blooded Laika regenerate 1/HP a turn. Laika eat double the amount of a typical dog.
        Poison Dart Dog - Inspired by the similarly named amphibian, a group of shaman deep within the jungles of Auyyuah have bred a line of canines capable of producing and expelling poisons. These dogs can at will exude a class 'M' poison. They are hairless and sleek creatures, with slick patches where the poison naturally pools.
        Platinum Retreiver - An offshoot of common hunting dogs, these somewhat dopey and friendly beasts can detect the presence of precious metals up to 60' away.

                A traveling merchant sells odd wooden closets, drawers, and chests. When opened, these objects lead to portals between dimensions. Suddenly, one of the closets tip over and the doors swing open
                You open the door and find yourself into a nearly empty room. No furniture, lamps, tables. There is one person inside, a female human. Blindfolded. She’s kneeling on the floor. In front of her is a small candle. 'To a question, an answer, then a toll. But beware, those who beckon secrets often find the roil of time hides only regrets.' She sais, then she remains silent.
                You see the ghost of an old woman, sweeping the ground. She wears old-style clothes, her face a translucent web of wrinkles. She smiles and says 'Oh, new folks. And such quaint garbs. Does thy yearn for any thing? I can’t help much, dead as I am, but I too much love this little corner of town to leave it behind, always glad to lend a hand if possible.'
                There is a rackety stand on the side of the road with an old, scarred man sitting behind it. The items on display are very… peculiar. Weapons, tools and trinkets with strange shapes and colours. Some are moving on their own, others seem very ancient. Many people pass by and check it out, but very few seem to be buying something. The old man sighs. He explains he used to be an adventurer, but now he’s getting married, so he wants to settle down and sell his old stuff for more useful cash. He already sold most of it, what’s left is the bizarre and weird stuff.
                You see a young woman walking about. Sixteen at most. She’s wearing simple white robes with the church symbol on them and a brown leather bag filled with herbs and bottles slung over her shoulder.
                You hear people arguing loudly, a small crowd is gathering on the side of the road around them. You see two guards screaming at a small, balding dwarf in a dirty white shirt. The dwarf seems very apologetic. After a while, the guards simply push him to the ground and walk away. The dwarf is a private investigator. He messed up a big case and created problems for the guards. He’s not bad at his job, he says. If given an opportunity, and fair pay, he’s eager to prove he’s a capable hound.
                The road opens up as if it was a colossal mouth, dozens of meters long. Inside, instead of dirt and rocks, its inside is fleshy and squirmy. A few passersby and a cart with horses fall inside, their screaming doesn’t last long. The road closes, trembles, you hear a brutal crunching and crushing and squishing, then it opens up again.
                As you walk through the city at night, you see a wobbling light coming towards you. It’s a lantern bearer, accompanying someone. From a distance, they appear to be regular folks, but as you get close, an unnerving sensation starts crawling up your skin. The one carrying the lantern is hunched forward and dressed in patched-up rags that drag on the ground. The other one seems like a nobleman, his black jacket has golden buttons and trimmings, he’s wearing a top hat and has a walking stick. When they are closer, the two stop, and you hear the well-dressed man tell the other 'Wait here, I’ll have a quick snack before we go.' Then he starts walking towards you.
                A runaway carriage is rushing towards you, there is no driver, the horses seem in a frenzy, neighing and frothing. As it gets closer, you notice a small, impish creature is attached to one of the horses, sinking its claws in its flesh.
                A young gnome lady is pushing a small cart filled with candles, crying 'buy a light, buy a light for the night, good sirs.' As she gets close, she looks at you, and you see wax dripping from her eyes. 'A candle to light the way,' she says, as she overthrows the cart. Melted wax floods out, streaming around you, boiling, burning your skin, but you feel something else, twisted, deep, burning away at your mind. 'A light to find your way in the dim abyss of truth, good sir. A candle for the demented halls of the mortal mind.'
                A group of laughing kids rushes through your group, some bumping into you. They don’t steal anything, instead, they put something in your pocket: a shiny, red gem, as large as a chicken egg. A few seconds later, a large minotaur wielding an oversized butcher knife turns the corner, bloodshot eyes, foaming. 'I can feel you have it, you swines!' He screams 'I will butcher you like the thieving pigs you are and dig my gem out of your carcasses.'
                A procession of rats carrying around the town insignia walks through the street. Created by an experiment from the local magical academy, these intelligent rats escaped years ago and have formed an enclave within the city.
                Today is a local festivity. Wagons with masked people playing instruments go through the city, while the people in the crowd throw fruit at each other. At the end of the day, sometimes, spirits of the dead appear for a few hours to visit their families and dine with them.
                The players pass in front of a ruined building in the middle of town. Broken walls, grass everywhere, cobwebs and graffiti feel really out of place, surrounded by regular, well-kept houses. It’s a desecrated church. Its cult abandoned it a long time ago after some horrible thing happened in it, and the church isn’t allowed to demolish, fix or repurpose it, since it technically belongs to the church, so it lies abandoned despite being prime real estate, left to the weather, the homeless and animals.
                The players hear screaming in the distance. They turn a corner, and the street is occupied by two large groups of people, some dressed in green and red, others in blue and yellow. They are beating each other, it’s a huge brawl that occupies most of the street. Around them, more people are cheering, waving flags and throwing flowers. Two families have been rivals for a long time, but over the centuries it has become more tradition than real hate. Now, they have an annual brawl where they pummel each other before going to eat together.
                A store owners helped a druid, and in exchange, he was blessed, now animals love him. As a result, the entire street around his house is filled with wild animals just hanging around: barking dogs, scuttling rats, meowing cats, insects, birds. Poop and fur everywhere.
                The players notice something peering at them from a rooftop. An enormous humanoid covered in rags and chain, its face a grey, expressionless mask with burning red eyes. It looks at them for a few, extremely uncomfortable seconds, then pulls back and disappears.
                A group of kids rushes in front of the players, laughing and kicking a ball of raw leather, they turn a corner and disappear. A few moments later, the same kids pass again. Then a third time, always in the same direction. They aren’t going back and forth, they are repeating. The fourth time, someone that looks identical to the player to the smallest detail is running and playing with the kids.
                In the middle of the night, one of the players wakes up. Something warm is dripping on them. There is an eviscerated pig carcass hanging right over their bed, dripping blood. Other severed animal parts covered in fresh blood surround their bed. Everything is warm and slippery.
                A player wakes up in the middle of the night, something is crawling on their back. Something tiny, but fast. As they try and fail to grab it, from below the sheets, something grabs their foot.
                The players are casually walking through town, when they notice people are staring at them, pointing and laughing. They realize all of their clothes and equipment have, somehow, been switched around. Nobody is wearing their own clothes, and they look ridicolous. Nobody has their own weapon at hand. None of them noticed it happening.

        keep/stronghold encounters
            An old woman goes around, knocking at people’s doors in the middle of night. If welcomed, she leaves peacefully. If not given hospitality, she curses the homeowners in bizarre ways, such as 'you’ll be a beast and your family will be turned into cutlery until someone falls in love with you.' The peasants are scared of this clearly insane witch wandering the land, and beg the players to stop her.
            The keep was build on top of an old dwarven cemetery. Every new moon, the dead rise and a bunch of short skeletons and ghosts attack the keep cantina. They break barrels of wine and drink the content, devour every plucked chicken and duck in the kitchen and cause mayhem.
            A new group of adventurers has just started their career in town, but they're murderhobos and have been doing a lot of damage.

As a result, they committed suicide together. Then, they came back as undeads and now haunt the lands of their families.
            Two families have been friends for generations, but two of the youngest members, barely adults, hate each other and challenge each other to violent duels. Sooner or later one of them will kill the other, or they could both die, and nobody wants that to happen
            A local mafia has been asking the locals to pay protection money and attacking the people that refuse. Problem is, the mafia actually does protect the people, and their private militia is pretty efficient. A lot of locals support them.
            A nearby goblin tribe has been encroaching on the players land. The goblins seem to be running away from something, but the farmers don't care. They just want the monsters out of their land.
            A nearby goblin tribe has been encroaching on the players land. The goblins seem to be running towards something, in a violent frenzy, trampling over any obstacle, as if attracted by a siren's call that nobody else hears.
            A nearby goblin tribe has been encroaching on the players land. The goblins say they were promised a portion of land by the previous lord, in exchange for 20 barrels of a rare goblin ale.
            Local sheep have gained sentience and refuse to be raised like animals. They have organized themselves in a commune and demand more rights and their own land where they can live in peace.
            There is a cave below the keep where enormous fungi grow. One day, they start growing outside, covering the keep walls and doors, infecting trees and animals.
            A group of devils appears in the backyard, they start taking measurements of the keep. When confronted, they say that the land belongs to them. They have a contract: The land was sold to them ten thousand years before, by the people owning it back then. From their point of view, it’s legally theirs, and the players have ten minutes to screw off before they get evicted.
            A drunken giant walks by, stumbling in confusion. He crawls inside the keep and falls asleep in the courtyard, blocking it.
            Three hundred years ago, a great hero was born in the keep, and pilgrims come from all over to visit. They don’t care for locked doors or local laws, and often they will steal things as souvenirs. Sometimes precious things, but often they will take curtains, pieces of furniture, cutlery, shoes, socks.
            A ghost haunts the castle. He was the castle owner, centuries before. The ghost spends his days getting drunk and harassing people in the open. Shouldn’t he, like, rattle chains and scream in the night? Well, he didn’t get a how-to-ghost pamphlet when he died, so excuse him if he’s not haunting in the 'proper' way. In the end, he’s a friendly guy, just kind of an asshole.
            A summoning went wrong, and the demon spirit got stuck in the piano in the music room. You can play it normally if you’re good, but If you hit the wrong note, the keys will bite your fingers. On a positive note, it never needs tuning. Just to be fed twice a week.
            A summoning went wrong, and a celestial spirit got stuck in a door. Now, it won’t let anyone through unless they prove to be worthy. The door takes its position very seriously and is pretty obnoxious.
            A powerful vampire lived in the castle, centuries ago, but it got destroyed by hunters. Or, nearly destroyed. The vampire is still alive, but it’s only a head, too weak to regenerate. It’s now kept inside a glass casing as decoration on a desk. You can talk with it, it’s a pretty intelligent head. It could, potentially, get its powers back by drinking blood, and tries to trick people into feeding it.
            There is an imposing statue in the courtyard, a hero fighting various monsters. On every full moon night, they animate, the monsters spread around the keep and the hero chases them down.
            There is a deep well in the back of the keep. It’s ancient, and nobody knows how deep it goes. The water in it causes hallucinations
            There is an empty room in the keep. If you try to put furniture in it, as soon as the room is empty, the doors will slam close, then, a terrible grinding sound will come out of it for a few minutes. When it’s done, the doors will open and the room will be empty again.
            There is a tower in the keep that is much older than the rest. The servants are scared of it, they talk of a cloaked figure with a lantern walking around it at night, and strange noises.
            A druid keeps intruding in the garden. He has very strong opinions on how the rest of the garden should be cultivated, the right way to prune, colour-coordination of flowers etc. and will harass and even attack the gardener if they disagree.
            A tree in the garden is inhabited by a dryad. She is extremely charismatic and a lot of peasants are friend with her, she gives advice, healing herbs and concoctions and farming tips. Some are starting to think she would be a pretty good town leader, even better than the players…
            Filth and garbage fall from the sky and over the keep. Half-eaten bones, poop, rotten fruit, it’s gross. Nobody knows where exactly they come from.
            At night, terrifying figures wander the village. They wear animals heads, or maybe they are half-animals, nobody knows but the peasants are terrified.
            A farmer’s field is become sentient and are attacking people. Humanoids made of tangled tomatoes, pumpkins ogres, zucchini knights, cabbage rangers and rice warlocks.
            A bizarre creature appears in the castle, a tangle of feathers and claws, beaks and tails and eggs and horns. It flies around for a while, breaking things and hurting people, then it blinks away and appears in another room, then again and again.
            A section of the castle is on fire, but it doesn’t seem to be spreading.
            There is a door that leads nowhere, it simply has a wall behind it. Sometimes, it opens and people walk out of it, confused foreigners from distant lands. Nobody has ever been able to use it to go back.
            A gang of kids and fairies is going around the village breaking windows, turning carts, liftings skirts and generally being annoying. Nobody has been able to catch them, thanks to the fairies magic.
            A priestess wants to open a chapel in the keep. She is extremely aggressive and self-righteous, but pretty good at divine magic.
            A wizard wants a laboratory in the keep, where nobody’s gonna annoy him about safety regulations or so-called 'crimes against nature', but he can pay very well.
            A neighbouring lord is visiting the keep. The man is wealthy and well-connected. He’s accompanied his daughter, who is independent and rebellious, and wants to become a ranger. The lord would be grateful to anyone that changed his daughter’s mind, and the daughter would be grateful to anyone that helped her escape.
            A neighbouring lord is visiting the keep. The man is too old to care, hates etiquette and loves parties. He’s accompanied his daughter, who hates poor people and fun and wants to uphold traditions. The lord will be grateful to anyone able to make his daughter loosen up, and the daughter will reward anyone that will allow her to replace her dad.
            A neighbouring lord is visiting the keep with his daughter. They are both raging assholes that look at every other person like filth, but they are part of a powerful and connected family.
            A neighbouring lord is visiting the keep with his daughter, they are both party animals with a habit of going too far and causing serious damages and starting fires, but they’re a lot of fun.
            No neighbouring lord is visiting the keep. That is bad for diplomacy, the players need to make their land more appealing, or they won’t be taken seriously and remain isolated.
            A hole opens in the middle of town, and a bunch of drow flood out. They’re refugees, running away from mind flayer slavers. They were forced to escape to the surface or die, and are out of options. If the players don’t shelter them, they will all die. Most of them are civilians. Many peasants are against it, and think its’ a trap, or that they deserve to die. The mind flayers are coming.
            A hole opens in the middle of town, and a bunch of slugs flood out. They crawl over people and bury in their brains. There is panic, but the 'infected' people seem fine, more or less. There is no immediate effect, and nobody is sure who or how many were infected.
            A hole opens in the middle of town and a blinding light floods out. Some people, as in a trance, start walking inside it and never come out. Every day more people go in the hole.
            An artist has settled in the village. Her art pieces are very, very good, but also disturbing, and seem to reveal people’s secret. They cause fights, start feuds and break up families.
            An artist has settled in the village. His art pieces are terrible beyond all comprehension and cause people to get sick and physical pain. After just a few days, some of them animate and turn into hideous monsters. Nobody knows where exactly the artist is hiding.
            A storyteller has arrived in town. He’s extremely charming, even too much: people stop working to listen to his tales, and some become unable to distinguish fiction from reality. Others lock themselves in their rooms, daydreaming, only coming out when a new tale is being told.
            There is a well in the keep, and sometimes coins fly out of it, followed by a voice making a wish. If the wish isn’t fulfilled, more coins arrive, but the voice is angry. Then pebbles start to fly out followed by cursing, eventually it’s rocks, knives and axes, then deadly spells.
            A metallic globe has appeared over the keep. It floats roughly a hundred meters in the air, immobile. Sometimes, it exudes blood that then rains over the keep.
            A couple of tailors arrive in town, they sell an incredibly rare material: an invisible cloth that only smart people can see. It is true, and people with Intelligence over 16 see it. It is very beautiful and comfortable and resilient.
            A woman arrives in town. She appears to be a regular peasant, but she’s very charismatic and starts rallying people to go to a holy war. She is very convinced of herself, and many are ready to follow. If they do, the town will lose a lot of its population and be unable to function, but she’s on a mission for God.
            A group of people that looks identical to the players arrives in town, pretending to be let into their keep. Who are these fools impersonating them, they ask? What trick is this? They demand the players get kicked out. The issue is, these fakes are all smarter and more likeable than the real ones, so many peasants are on their side.
            A servant rushes to the players, covered in sweat. A woman is dying. She overdosed on some weird drugs that a gnome sold them that they were doing together. They’re secretly in a relationship, but she’s the daughter of a nearby nobleman. If she dies or their relationship is revealed, it will be a mess. Her father could very well start a war. He fucked up dude, but they gotta help him, or they’ll all be in troubles.

    moral dillemas
        You finally have the villain at your mercy, but their child is with them. Are you willing to kill an innocent child's parent in front of their very eyes?
        The village is going to be culled to prevent the spread of a terrible plague. Do you spare the villagers by preventing the cull at risk of millions of lives dying to plague?
        The villain has framed you for a crime you didn't commit, but to resist arrest would make it more likely that your reputation as an outlaw sticks with you permanantly. Do you turn yourself in?
        The wizard sent you on a simple errand: decomission his malfunctioning golem, but when you find the golem it is exhibiting obvious signs of sentience, and self awareness. Does it deserve the freedom of other sentient beings?
        The villain shares a common goal/enemy with the party and suggests declaring a truce to deal with the situation. Do you work together with your sworn enemy?
        You captured some enemy soldiers for information and have them at your mercy. Do you let them go and risk them giving away your position or slaughter the unarmed troops? 
        Your party is guilty of a crime (aren’t they all at some point?) and the local law enforcement has arrested someone else for it. Do you turn yourself in and save the person, or do you let them try him so you can remain out of prison?
        Your party is contracted to deal with a group of bandits that has been waylaying merchants on the road, miles outside of town. It turns out that the spoils of these robberies are being redistributed to the poor citizens. 
        The villain is currently holding a hostage that the party hates but the public loves. (u//MojoDragon365)
        The king, who has proven himself to be a great ally and a terrifying enemy, has charged you to escort a caravan of people to be sold into slavery 
        A bottle of stolen mead has been found by the party after a merchant warns them to be on the lookout for it. However, the rare mead is unattended and probably worth a nice chunk of change. The party can either steal it, sell it, and tell the merchant what they did, lie about stealing it, return it to the merchant, or do nothing. If the party ends up stealing or returning the mead, a later quest will reveal it was honestly bought and that the merchant, now gone, is something of a scammer. 
        You come to a crossroads and suddenly from the north a girl comes running down saying 'please help....they are about to sacrifice my sister' And then a boy comes running up from the other direction 'please help...my village is under attack' Helping the girl stop the sacrifice summons a demon but the sister is saved and the other village is slaughtered. Saving the village means the sister is sacrificed and the girl stalks the party waiting for her moment to strike to get revenge 
        You see a bear following a child who was yelling in another language, if the party kill the bear, the girl runs backs to his werebear father while he is dying.

        The party comes cross an infant gnoll, crying over the corpse of its dead parent. It may be an inherently chaotic and evil creature, but it is still young—do they leave it, kill it, or try to help it? 
        A local mimic wants to stop being used as furniture. Does the party kill it, or take pity and relocate the poor creature 
        The party were the only witnesses to a child stealing something from a stall, but the city punishes stealing with death. If the party doesn't describe (and thus likely condemn) the child to death, the blame will fall on the only other possible thieves: themselves. 
        A local lord and his knights have recently killed an adult dragon which had been terrorizing the surrounding lands for years. There's one last job: go to the dragons lair and exterminate it's clutch of eggs and the remaining wyrmlings. None can survive or the lairs effects on the region will never go away. 
        There's a deadly and neigh-unbreakable curse that jumps from parent to biological child when the parent dies. The current curse bearer is a powerful wizard who keeps it at bay with ritual sacrifice of humanoids, using their souls to empower his resistance. The wizard has many children and dozens of grandchildren, and if he's killed, they'll quickly die from the inherited curse, them lacking his ability to resist it. 
        A senile old wizard has been secluded in the mountains, summoning mass amounts of monsters to keep himself from being lonely. The monsters run away from him out of fear but savagely kill innocents. Does the party kill him to stop the killings or go to the trouble of trying to find help for him. 
        There's a prophecy that a young child, descendant of a great hero, will be the gateway for a great demon to come back into this world by bursting out of the kid's chest. An evil wizard can get the demon out without harming the child, but the demon will be under the wizard's control. Do the heroes wait to see if the prophecy is false (it's not), enlist the help of the wizard and have to deal with that problem later, or murder the great-great-great-great grandchild of the man who saved the entire kingdom? 
        Your party gets hired by a wealthy collector to transport an artifact purchased from the town over. When they arrive in the other town, they find out the artifact they are to transport is a little girl. 
        A quest to go slay a nearby ogre is posted in a tavern. The ogre has no interest in hurting anyone but doesn't want to leave either. Gemstones poking out of the walls of the caves hint at why the bounty was placed. 
        You are fighting your way to a dragon's lair through some surprisingly smart owl bears, shambling mounds, treants, and other typically dumb creatures. You learn that to destroy the dragon's (or other BBEG) power will be to rob all these creatures of their intelligence that they now prize so dearly. partially based on a post by
        A level in the dungeon is filled with monsters and deadly traps, but also cages filled with innocents in the way. If the party isn't careful they are likely to be killed. 
        The local village is holding a firbolg named Thorbyrn prisoner, saying he killed one of the local guardsmen. The firbolgs have always been peaceful and all evidence suggests he’s not the culprit. He’s to be executed in the morning and the party must decide if they will save him. 
        A village is under the influence of a long forgotten goddess of Fertility who requires blood sacrifices to work her magic. Without the sacrifices, the crops are eaten by pests, die to diseases from the soil, or don't even make enough food for a small child. 
        You've been called to kill a bunch of 'evil' creatures (goblins, orcs, whatever) but find that while they're not the best ever they're also the victims of discrimination and being kept out of 'honest' ways to make a living 
        You receive a powerful magic item that perfectly fits in with your character's abilities, but are warned soon after earning it that the more you use it, the more that your morality will be corrupted. Will you use it or destroy it? 
        You've come across a group of revolutionary inventors, they've created things that will change the path of history for the better. You find out they've invented everything sacrificing innocent, unwilling, lives in the testing process. Do you stop them?

        There's a secret group of werewolves among the people in a small village. They've been feeding on livestock; however, they are also responsible for keeping the monsters in the surrounding area at bay. The villagers want their livestock safeguarded, but the werewolves are desperate to remain a secret so they can be with their families. 
        The party has slain the evil tyrant, and freed the kingdom, but discovered that the reason the tyrant ruled so harshly was to prepare the kingdom to fight against an even greater threat.

        a magic mcguffin is very important to the survival of a town, you learn that a criminal gang are planning to steal it and they're recruiting new members to assist. A perfect opportunity to infiltrate and save the town, except the mcguffin would be really useful to your master quest.

            the culmination of the efforts of generations of scholars.
            author was taken by a eerie mood and wrote the work in a fortnight.
            it merely appeared one day, fully formed.
        
        what form does it take?
            tablets made of...stone/clay, metal, wax, wood.
            tome bound in...leather, metal, ivory, loose sheaves.
            scroll crafted of...paper, hides, leaves, cloth.
            graffiti, scrawling or runes etched onto a...structure, natural feature, path or road, cave.
            tangles of intricate ropes and beads in a language that may not still be known. may be read in the dark.

            the true names of...celestials, fiends, genies, fae.
            exhaustively indexed knowledge on an extremely niche topic such as elven architecture or goblin poetry. worth a small amount to most, but a huge sum to the right collector.
            a creeping form of madness which provides insight into the world. in exchange for losing one's mind permanently, the bearer of the work may ask it questions and gain answers 1d6 times per day as if they were using the spells find the path, augury, identify or clairaudience.
            a compendium covering the habits and weaknesses of...outsiders, aberrations, magical creatures, undead.

            the work is a keystone or plug of sorts, if removed or reproduced then...the area containing the work shakes itself to bits in 1d6 minutes, undead begin to appear around where the work is held, animals of all stripes become hostile to whomever bears it, bad luck follows the bearer, the referee may impose disadvantage on 1d2 rolls per day at their discretion.
            a cult or religious order is dedicated to safeguarding the work in some way. if it is stolen of copied without consent then they will surely seek to rectify the situation.
            magically bound to defend the work in some way until their destruction, the guardian takes the form of a(n)...powerful undead creature, outsider, monster, construct.
            only certain type of folk are able to read the work, it is gibberish to everyone but...non-spellcasters, followers of an obscure faith, the mad, someone who has never taken a life.

        No one except adventurers are brave enough to eat at a place built under the lightning rail so the merchants and needy townsfolk stay away.

    The being
        A three-headed being looks down upon you from the sky, one face scowling, one crying, and one smiling.

Nightmares
    You find yourself stranded in a desert, only sand from horizon to horizon. You keep walking but the dunes don't seem to come any closer. You feel extremely thirsty and slowly but steadily, your energy starts to fade. Hours seem to pass and when youre getting desperate, the sand in front of you starts to shift, a giant scorpion emerges and starts chasing you. 
    You stand before all those who have been affected by your rampant killings throughout your adventure. A wife who committed suicide after you killed her husband, a bandit. A son, clinging to his mother and asking when his father will be home. A woman, weeping for the loss of her daughter. A man brought to tears by the loss of his husband. They weep and ask why you've brought them such pain. You cannot see yourself and it is unclear whether they are actually referring to you or to the cursed item which is giving the dream. 
    You're having a normal dream and everything is 100% fine, then all of a sudden, certain items start to grow, then shrink, then grow, then shrink. You have no control of what it is or if it grows or shrinks and your forced to be 100% concentrated on this object. You're completely aware you're dreaming but can't stop. Whilst this is happening, a loud, deep bass drum is going off every couple seconds, it almost sounds like a war drum. You can hear it but you can't comprehend what is going on or where it's coming from. 
    You dream about $the next encounter$. 
    You are fighting a shadow rival, and the nightmare is different dependent on where you are sleeping: In the mountains, your rival attacks with a sword of ice and rock; In the forest, your rival strikes from shadows and bushes all around; In the desert, your rival attacks with a scorpion's tail; In a town, every passing villager is your rival; By the sea, your rival pins you underwater, gasping for air; Just before you awaken soaked in sweat, your shadow rival's face lightens to reveal your own reflection. 
    You're in a dimly lit room, you see a butterfly or moth struggling to fly and flapping against the wall. Walking over to investigate, you reach out to gently touch the grey creature, only for it to fall into dust as soon as you touch it. 
    You dream that you are chased by countless slow walking zombies and you can't defend yourself even if you want to. Also the floor is very slippery, like you are on a frozen lake, no matter how hard you try, you can't run properly. 
    You dream that the letter you were searching for a long time is in your hands now, but you can't read it, but everybody expects you to read it. You want to take your time but it gets worse and the letter begins to burn in your hands. You have a little time to read this important information, good luck trying. 
    You dream that you are a constant state of falling. Everytime you think that you are going to hit the floor, a gigantic monster appears and swallows you to another dimension and you keep falling in there too. 
    You find yourself in a battle for whatever cause you champion, whether it be the safety of a loved one or the annihilation of your most despised enemies. The battle is a crucial one, one you’ve prepared for for months; however, every strike you make falls short, your body feels sluggish whenever you move to attack - as if you’re wearing full plate underwater or you’re one of those squishy wizard-folk - all your spells fizzle and drown as you find yourself unable to speak. You watch helplessly as you fail to protect your loved ones from horrible fates, your empire crumbles around you, and your every last pleasant dream lies in shambles at your feet. 
    You dream that you've lost all of the skill and experience you've gained over your travels. If you were a melee user, you feel your muscles wither away and your attacks are as weak as a child, a magic user, your spells backfire or are weak and useless, an archer would watch his arrows fly wildly off-target, etc. You can get creative with the description here, if a PC is proud of a certain skill you could describe in brutal detail how awful they've become. 
    You dream that your body is overtaken by a malicious presence, and you watch as a helpless captor while it slays your companions using your body 
    You dream that you've died, and your companions forget about you completely. Meanwhile, you linger on as a spirit and watch your party go on without you and meet great success, seemingly much better without you dragging them down. 
    In your dream you suffer a grave wound, and instead of saving you, your party decides to put you out of your misery, you spring awake just as you feel the cold steel of the blade meet your neck. 
    You go out for a night on the town with your friends. All is well and you are having a great time. Eventually the inevitable time comes when you must rest. Finally alone, the faint music and noise of the tavern behind you, you feel relaxed and at ease. Strangely relaxed, even as a hand morphs out of the wall in front of you. It gives a slow wave, so you feel like it is friendly and even wave back. Strange, when did it get a friend? Why do they keep trying to touch you? You decide to leave and try to turn away but there are more hands beside you now and they grab you. No matter how hard you try, you cannot break free, more and more of them grab at you, pulling you towards the wall. You manage to get out loudly as they somehow pull you into it, but you are cut off as a hand covers your mouth and pulls you through the wall. You see your friends rush into the room and bite the hand and try to shout to them, but they cannot hear or see you from this side of the wall. You watch them search for you fruitlessly until you are pulled screaming further into darkness. 
    You dream that you wake up normally, however as soon as you speak for the first time, you are interrupted mid sentence by biting your own tongue. You try to curse the pain away only to spit blood and teeth from your mouth. Frantically you scramble to grab them with one hand while trying to stop the flow of blood from your mouth with the other. You can feel more of your teeth falling from your gums into the sea of blood filling your mouth. Strangely, the person you were talking to does not seem shocked by this and continues on normally. You try to shout to them for help, hell, for anything, even a bowl to catch the pieces of you falling off, but only succeed in spraying them with a mouthful of blood and your remaining teeth. They still seem unphased, even as you raise your hands to your mouth in surprise to feel it, only to have your lower jaw slough off. Panicking you reach for them, only to find that your limbs crumple at the joints as you try to move them. Your entire body slowly crumpled as bits break or fall off until you are nothing more than a blob of mangled human parts in disarray, staring up at your friend as breathing becomes harder and harder to do. You wake up just after you black out. 
    You are awakened by strange noises outside. Some sort of loud commotion. You decide to get ready and investigate. As you head out, you are stopped by someone close to you. They start trying to tell you something. By the way their hands move, it must be important, but only an inhuman screeching comes out of their mouth when they talk. Their lips don't even move. You try to get them to repeat themselves and they seem to get frustrated and grab a notepad. You feel a slight relief for a moment before they turn the pad to you so you can see what they have wrote and it is just jagged scribbles. Others try to help them explain what's going on to you and progressively everyone gets more and more frustrated but you still can't understand them. You wake up screaming as one of your party members jumps on in a rage after an extended effort trying to get the point across to you. 
    You find yourself seemingly restrained, looking down you see your a baby swaddled in a course blanket. An unseen figure picks you up and begins to carry you, walking at a slow hobbled giant. Eventually you are laid down on a forest floor and the unseen figure walks away. A rat scampers over to you and climbs on your chest, you feel yourself smiling at it, soon there are more, 3, 6, a dozen, two dozen! They climb over biting into your flesh until you succumb to death from a 1000 bites. 
    You’re racing away from a darkness that threatens to swallow you. Something about this darkness and it’s inky blackness seems to be erasing everything it touches and the daylight begins to dwindle. You claw a slide down the edge of a wet leafy steep and slip into the pond far below. You expect cool water to wash over you but it’s oddly warm. You breech the surface and are horrified to discover you’re swimming in a pool of vomit. It’s in your mouth and nose, choking you as you start to drown, gagging over and over. Finally you realize that you are laying down, and the gagging is real, that you are actually beginning to choke on your own vomit. The character continues gagging afterwards for 15 minutes. 
    You're walking along a path when a heavy silence falls, like a great weight is placed on you. You look up to a forest in flames as large monstrous heads on necks higher than trees glare down upon you. 
    You slowly wipe the tears from your eyes before opening them. All around you the crowd shouts. 'You are a terrible person.' 'You should never have existed.' 'Scum of the earth.' Wiping more tears from your eyes you slowly turn your head upwards. Before you, silhouetted by the gray cloudy sky, stands a tree with a rope hanging from it. A hooded figure places a platform beneath it. A person is pushed towards it. You wish you could forget them but you can't. It's your partner of over 300 of your most beautiful, wonderful, joyful moons. The crowd's shouting gets louder. 'Murderer.' 'Terrorist.' 'Villain.' You continue to watch, knowing they are innocent with all of your heart, mind, and soul. The shouting gets louder. Your world is consumed, leaving only the shouting, the rope, and the love of your life. The shouting reaches its peak as the rope is tied around their neck. You can't take it any more. Rushing forward towards the tree, crying out in agony all the way. You push aside a guard and feel cold, hard steel piece through your back. A lung ruptures, but before you die you hear one last thing, 'You could have lived. It only had to be me.' Darkness fills your vision as the rope goes taut. 
    The weight of a cask of ale presses down upon your back as you return to your home village from the city. Birds sing as they fly through the sky's bright, cloudless blue. You set down the cask for a rest and begin to play a joyful tune on your ukulele. Gray clouds begin rise over the horizon but they don't look quite normal. After some thought you realize that it is smoke coming up from the only place you've ever known. The birds go silent as you leave the cask behind and start running. The cries of your people blend with screams of the invaders before echoing across the landscape. Praying to all of the gods, you continue only to run face to face with a strange person clad in dark armor and wielding a shining sword. Past them you can see your parents on the ground crying over the body of your sibling. Your childhood friend sees you and shouts to run while you can. The attacker grabs you and kicks you to the ground. Another one approaches and begins to mock you. You wish you could do something to stop this. You would willing surrender your life to end the suffering of your people. But that chance never comes, a sword pierces through your heart and you fall to the ground. The last sounds you hear are the cries of your parents and the angry shouts of your friend. Your vision fills with red before fading to black. 
    The bustling crowds push past you as you walk to your favorite bar. Once you arrive at your normal seat an unfamiliar dwarf comes up to you and sits down. 'I have an opportunity for you.' Intrigued you start paying very close attention. The dwarf pulls out a rune covered deck of cards, 'How many do you want.' After some questioning they explain that the cards are items of great power. You agree to take third cards and pull out the first one. On the first card a bright, golden, almost glowing orb appears. Years of experience flood through your mind while a belt wraps itself around you causing strength to surge through your body. Extremely satisfied with the outcome you pull out one more. On this card a the image of a golden key glows before a powerful magic $Important Item$ appears in your grasp. You can sense the sword or whatever] would strip away the soul of anyone unfortunate enough to get hit by you. The third card has a cloaked figure on it and no apparent effect occurs. You try to thank the dwarf but find they have already left. After celebrating by getting thoroughly drunk you return to your home and pass out almost as soon as you enter. You awake to find your spouse standing over you and bring down your new sword or bring down a sword whilst wearing your new whatever] on your throat. The air escapes your lungs and you hear nothing from them before your vision fades to dark. 
    A small sidewalk cafe in the open market. The character is seated and finds the body feels so heavy As to be unable to rise. Waiters and then passersby stop one after the other in front of the player placing plates full of offal in front of them. Disgust colors their faces as they take the plate away empty. The character doesn't remember eating but feels fuller and fuller. The crowds begin cutting of their own body parts to set before the player only to react in fear and loathing as empty plates are taken away. If the player ever tries to actually eat what is front of them they look down and see their own half eaten body and blood on their hands. 
    Climbing up the circular interior stairway of a tower castle the sense of something BAD following increases. The faster the character tries to get away the tighter and tighter the hall becomes until the press is suffocating. If the player turns around they find the stairs crumbling behind them into a void where they would fall forever. 
    A giant approaches and you reach for you weapon only to find an empty sheath. The creature laugh as it points out you forgot your pants as well. The rest of the party starts to chuckle also until one then the other notices that (whomever of the party the character likes most) has been slain with the lost weapon. 
    You are a Shepard, tending to your flock of sheep. You feel relaxed as you count them jumping over a fence, one by one. But pretty soon the sheep coming over the fence becomes a flood as they swarm around you. Soon you are completely surround, tormented by their inhuman moans as they stare at you with their alien eyes. 
    you dream that you are drowning in ghostly hands that pull you into the ground while the item floats before you 
    you dream a friend gives you a gift in a box and when you open it, the item lies inside and when you look back at your friend they are swiftly withering into a corpse 
    you dream of walking through a large empty house at night and tormented voices call to you behind closed doors but never anyone behind them 
    you dream you're standing at the banks of an icy lake at night and you can hear the item call your name over and over, knowing it lies at the bottom of the lake while silent figures around from the bank point at you, their eyes milky white 
    you dream that you visit a royal figurehead but when you are left alone with them, they begin to choke on blood in their mouth and the guards enter, convinced that you are the murderer 
    You're in an outhouse, when something big starts slamming on the door, trying to break it down. The slamming slowly gets louder, and you try to get up to escape, but you find yourself chained to the seat. The banging suddenly stops. The door creaks open and you hear a rasping breath, a cold chill engulfs you. You hear the breath get louder and louder, until it feels like it's almost in your ear. Then suddenly, the thing screams in your ear and you wake up in a cold sweat, screaming. 
    A little child stands before you. They reach out a hand towards you as if for help. An ax appears nested in their skull. A spear appears through their heart. They screams as blade after blade impale them; crying out for you to end it; end their misery. A small obsidian glass dagger appears in your hand. But you can’t do it. You wake up with a start, sweating, with the dagger clutched in your fist. 
    You are writing a letter or playing an instrument at a feverish pace, but your fingers start to quickly grow weak and you lose sensation in them. The skin and muscles on your fingers slowly starts to rot off the bone, but you cant stop moving them until the bare bone that remains falls off and you are left with only a bleeding stump for a hand. 
    You have a ship to catch. It leaves in just a few minutes and it is absolutely imperative you get on it. But for every few steps you take, the road shifts so that it goes at right angles to the path to the ship, and it lengthens. You keep going faster and faster, but cannot catch up. Periodically, you come upon people who ask you questions, and you have to give the right answer to move on, or something terrible will happen. 
    Your party is is the entrance to the $BBEG'S_LAIR$. Your comrade says 'On three. 1...2...' You glance down. You are naked, directly under the continual light globe in the ceiling, forgot to prepare any spells this morning and are not proficient in the bizarre exotic weapon in your hand. Your friends look at you expectantly to lead the charge. ... '3!!!!!' 
    You go about your day as usual, when you suddenly feel your teeth loosening as you touch them with your tongue. They start to fall out one by one, and you can't do anything against it.
    You find yourself sitting at a table in a dark room along with others, trapped in an hypnotic state and mumbling sentences while referring to yourself in third-person. 
    The dream is wonderful. All of your friends and family are there. Even the ones who have passed away. You feel elated and joyful. Everyone lives forever in the light. Then, slowly you realise that this can’t be real. People do die. Most of these people are dead. You will die too. 
    You are traveling a road by your self. The road begins to wrap around and suddenly you realize you're traveling in a circle you can't escape from. No where to go but forward you encounter someone traveling ahead of you on the same direction . As you catch up to him/her you they began to seem familiar. As you get close enough, you see it is yourself, only horribly disfigured. A gaping wound in your chest. And your face horribly scarred. This future version of you gasping for air says 'don't trust them' and falls over. 
    you are fighting with your closest friends against a horrible monster (beholder or something similar) when you are suddenly compelled to turn against those who have saved you countless times and whom you have grown to love and trust. you slowly kill them before killing yourself out of grief. 
    You are running from a horrifying monster the likes of which you've never seen before. He moves at a slower pace than you but he never seems to tire while you feel yourself fading quickly. Up ahead you see a house. Safety! Surely, if you get inside and lock the door you can buy time to find a hiding place. Your speed picks up, energy renewed at the thought of safety. Finally making it you slam open the door and dart inside. You survey your surroundings when suddenly you feel a hot breath on your neck. In that instant one terrible thought makes itself horribly clear. 'I forgot to lock the door.' 
    You dream you are staring into a mirror, your reflection smiles evilly at you before turning its back to you and walking away. The world surrounding you starts turning to glass and crystal, as your body turns to glass you awake. 
    A giant crystallized skull floats in space surrounded by stars, as the skull rotates to face you you catch a glimpse of light shining from inside the skull through one of its eye sockets. 
    You are sitting with your friends at a table in a tavern, having a meal when suddenly you find yourself bringing up a secret you hide from them. Then closest or more vulnerable friend]'s head rolls off. The severed head says 'no wonder you hid this, you monster.' You look down, your meal has turned to blood. You look back up. All your friends have lost their heads now, and they lay slumped over the table. 
    You are trapped in a giant butler's sink in dirty water and the plug has been removed and the water is beginning to swirl pulling you round and down sweeping you past giant utensils just too distant or too fast to catch. 
    You are nothing more than an imaginary puppet dancing to the tune of laughing godlike beings who decide your fate with a casual toss of dice. 
    Your party have forgotten you exist, and are trying to kill you or they torture you instead 
    You dream of getting stitches from a huge living orange with an artificer's crank-powered sewing machine... 
    You start by entering a room. There's a chest. It's a mimic. You run and open a door. It's a mimic. You bring out your sword. It's a mimic. The room is a mimic. Your chestplate is a mimic. Your helmet is a mimic. YOU are a mimic. 
    You’re wandering alone in a forest. It’s dark and cold, but there’s no snow, just a bitter frost that clings to everything. You can feel the numbness in your fingertips slowly spread up your hands and arms. You vaguely understand that you won’t last long - that you WILL die if you don’t find shelter from the cold. Up ahead you see a light. Maybe an inn? Just a small cottage? At this point anything will do. You try to walk towards it, but you can’t control your shivering and you collapse on the forest floor. You can’t move your fingers, but you can claw your way forward, inch by inch. Finally, you’re at the edge of the clearing, but you’ve used the last of your strength. The cold binds your screams in your throat, and your body shakes uncontrollably. Eventually even that ceases, and all you can do is watch the people through the windows as the frost covers your eyes. As you struggle to hang on to your last breath, knowing that once you breathe out no more air will enter your lungs, you wake and realize your chest hurts from holding your breath. 
    You sit next to a campfire. The party members surround you. You all tell stories, recite poems and jokes, and drink to your hearts content. Eerily, you hear a soft whisper in your ear, and you feel a sharp blade crawl across your neck. You watch in horror as your closest friends observe you bleeding to death and do nothing to help you. 
    In a bustling city you watch you party members getting slowly eaten by giant $Terrifying_Creature$. None of the citizens around you seem to hear you or do anything about it. 
    You find yourself laying down in a heap of snow in a frozen forest, barely alive, your friends are around you... (they are either all laying down, all standing, all dead, etc) 
    You find yourself at home, in the night outside your house. A terrifying attacker chases you inside, only to find your family/friends who are too busy to even take notice. You fall victim to the attacker as they sit idly by, ignoring your screams. 
    You find yourself among a crowded urban area, a market perhaps. However, you quickly realize everything, from folk to beast to nature itself, is running backwards in time. You try to interact with someone, to no avail. Suddenly you notice a hooded figure across the street staring at you. As you try to discern it's shape, you see a humanoid creature with an upside down face, screeching as it points in your direction 
    You and your companions are having a meal. Only thing is, there's no food, only charcoal on the plates. You turn it away, but everybody is staring at you seriously. You feel a hit on the back of your skull and dizzily watches without reacting your friends tying you to the chair and force-feeding you. It tastes like ash and you feel your throat bleeding as you swallow. 'You gotta eat, $Name$' 'Gotta keep your fire lit'. 
    You stand at the end of a large stone and wood bridge, the land around you dead and barren, the sky dark aglow with an eerie orange light. The wind howling as you scan around, you notice the bridge and the surrounding area as place from your childhood. Though then it was vibrant and lush with life thriving all around. As sadness and despair begin to settle into your gut you hear a ferocious wicked growl. From the shadows a large beast with razor sharp teeth, gnarled spines growing out of it's back, and blood thirty eyes starts moving towards. You try and runaway but move slowly as the horror approaches, half way across the bridge you stand consumed in shadow. The beast is upon you and ready to... 
    You are walking on the docks at night with your? child, you look to your left and a massive serpent made of black bones slowly rises from the dark water. You freeze but your? child keeps moving, playfully running forward. You wake up as the serpent lunges at your child?. 
    It's winter, you're a wolf running with your pack. They find something to eat in the snow and you join them. After a few bites you look down, you've been eating the half frozen remains of your loved one. 
    A $Charming_Friendly_Creature$ offers you blueberry cake. You eat the cake, and begin to expand and turn blue. Then your adventuring comrade yells 'Gonna Pop!' and everyone ducks for cover! 
    You wake up in your camp and hear the soft crunching of branches. As you look, you hear a growl behind you. As you turn to face it, a $Terrifying_Creature$ leaps at you. You feel warm breath on your face as it begins to take a bite! 
    You're hunting for an offender, and as you are about to shoot, they hide behind the last tavernkeep you saw. You shot them instead and the offender's shadow looms over you. Smothering you! 
    You're on a sandy beach and realize $Skittering_Creatures$ are crawling all over you. They engulf you completely. 
    You find yourself at a gathering of those you admire. Great heroes, beautiful lovers, and influential figures. They're all looking at you with admiration. You open your mouth to speak, but you feel your teeth begin to fall out. As each one clinks to the stone floor, you can feel the disgust roll over you, the taste of blood in your mouth making you sick as you wake up gagging. 
    You see (npc or character they're most attached to) approaching, as you go to embrace them you notice a look of surprise then pain cross their face, as you look down you see your hand, scarlet, as the blood drips down your elbow the drops in the pool of blood bring you back to awareness, they whisper one word 'Why?' as the tears run down their face mixing with the blood the last thing you hear is the dripping of the blood flowing down your arm. You awaken to the sound of the rains last drops collecting in a pool nearby. 
    You move to awaken $party_member$ for their turn on watch, but as you move you notice an odd weakness in your legs, as you look down you notice for the first time the flesh on your hands slowly melting and sloughing off revealing the pitted/ rotted bone beneath, as you go to scream out in horror/pain,your legs give out from beneath you, the impact knocking the breath from your lungs. As you lay there feeling your body slowly dissolve, unable to draw breath you see a pair of malevolent feline eyes staring at you from the lowest branch in the tree you were resting against, the cat begins to take shape and as it leaps at you it bursts apart as a swarm of spiders engulfing you, you awaken to your own screams, realizing it was just a dream, but a prickling along your spine and the echoes of a malicious laugh leave you wondering, was it really only a dream? 
    It's hot. Humid. You're holding an unfamiliar crossbow-like weapon. You lie motionless in a row of bushes along the edge of a flooded grain field. Dragonfly-shaped airships circle overhead with a powerful thumping sound, and begin to debark men clad in green. With a stuttering roar, some kind of automated wand sprays red magic missiles into the green-clad men from somewhere on your left. Their crossbow-like weapons glow with flickering star-shaped flame as they respond. You wake with a start, wondering what that even was. 
    You are being pursued by an immense fat demon made of glass. You can only run, because if you try to hide, it bursts through even the stoutest stone wall with a cry of 'OH YEAH!' Brilliant red ichor sloshes visibly within its skin at every step. 
    The party is ambushed by goblins. Just as you are about to enter the fray, you feel a breeze. One of your party members asks if you're forgetting something. You look down and see that you are nude. The party laughs. The goblins laugh. You wake up cold, the blanket having slid off the bed. 
    An airship envelops you in golden light and you float up from the ground. A group of hairless gray Deep Gnomes straps you to a table and performs a thorough examination. Uncomfortably thorough. They shine a glittering light in your eyes and you jerk awake. It's an hour before dawn and you can't recall making camp last night, even though the tents are set up. 
    You are standing above the sky, leaning against a wall of glass, looking down on the familiar coastline of your homeland, made strange by this new perspective. A menacing shape, clearly made of metal, slides soundlessly into view and begins to project beams of light at the points you know hold towns. 
    You're in complete agony. You move the hand away from your mouth to see it is covered in blood. The blood continues to drip on the sides of your mouth. You run to the nearby commoners walking among the streets begging for help except nothing you say makes sense. The words appear to be gurgled by the amount of blood. They look at you strangely and push you away as you bleed on their clothing. Looking into a mirror placed in front of a store, you use your hands to spread your mouth open and realize that your tongue has been extracted. The amount of blood begins to overtake you and you begin to choke. It is at that moment you wake up with a burning sensation in the back of your throat. You were choking on saliva in your sleep. 
    The bed you are sleeping in is really a mimic and is trying to eat you! 
    Your loved one is secretly a doppelganger and your real loved one is held captive far away. 
    Your favorite possession has been stolen and been replaced by a fake replica. 
    You're stuck in a white room with an eerie-looking statue. You don't know why, but something's telling you that you really need to leave or something horrible will happen. 
    You're stuck in some kind of time-loop, reliving the same day over and over again. Nobody will believe you, even as you predict every detail you've spent the last month or so seeing over and over. 
    A surreal rendition of $next_planned_encounter$. It takes a sharp deviation from the original when a shadowy creature picks the party off one by one and the dreamer is helpless to stop it. 
    You are stranded in a painted desert, and the sun is perpetually setting. The dry, dusty ground becomes a riverbed which flash floods and drags you under. 
    You are a bird, flying over someone dying. You alight next to them and they reach for you. 
    You are dying. A bird alights next to you. Then more. You are whisked up in a flock of small birds who peck and scratch. You know there will soon be no trace of you left, but you cannot.. or must not move. 
    A collection of live butterflies and winged insects sits in front of you, glittering like jewels. Your $Stern_Parental_Figure$ stands over your left shoulder instructing you in the method of euthanizing, and then mounting the insects for display and study. They tell you that you are not done despite all the bugs having been mounted. You realize they mean to have you mounted last, and expects you to do everything but the final pin. 
    Your teeth are loose. You pull one out by accident, but a second grows into it's place. You pull a second, and a third... 
    You see yourself in the mirror. You smile, and have too many teeth, and then your reflection drags you into the mirror and begins devouring you. 
    You go to show your friends some cool thing you can suddenly do, and find they are dead.. rotting hunks of flesh, but still moving. They bite and scratch, clawing at you, trying to drag you down. 
    You are lost and naked. Something is pursuing you, and the further you run the larger and more frightening it becomes, eventually looming on the horizon. 
    Wandering the labynthian corridors of a place you once knew well, seeking a murderer hiding amongst your friends. It starts to snow and inside the building there are snowdrifts everywhere. It is quite cold, and you are nearly naked. Your friends don't beleive you that there is a murderer and that it is snowing. You are also late, the murderer has killed one of your friends, and know that if you do not find the killer soon, then more of your friends will die. 
    A dream where you wandering through a cave populated with mannequins. All of whom are wearing the faces of your friends and family. At the back is a mannequin whose back is turned to you. You find yourself terrified at looking upon its face. But you don't know why... 
    You dream of your family members that are still alive are brutally murdered by someone or something. 
    Your beloved family pet turns on you, and you are forced in defense to choke it. It does not relent its attack as you do, and you're forced to continue choking until it dies. Its head swells and throbs with its heartbeat as you continue the hold, and it dies as the animal's scalp and face explode from the pressure of the blood you choked it with. Your pet falls dead from your hands, a brutal mess, and all the good memories you had with it flash before you and seem to crumble. 
    Your dream that you have severed ties with $best_friend$; yet contact continues, and they seem to be nearly everywhere in your life. They betrayed you, yet everywhere you go and everything you involve with they seems to be there. Frustrated, you approach them near a stream and berate them that it was they who wronged you and still goes where they know you will be. You begin to argue in earnest, screaming and furious, and as your vision blurs and tunnels, you find you have wrestled them to the bank of the stream, and to try to silence his screams, push his head in the water. Before you know it they are dead in your hands! 
    You are in a noble's salon, moving among salaciously dressed courtesans. Every drink you sip tastes like sand, and every caress fills you with horror. When you sit at the table they all set to, devouring the meat, but the sickly sweet smell of it makes you think of corrupted flesh, and the thought of eating it turns your guts. 
    You dream that you're in a dark room, and random body parts of all different races are appearing and disappearing sporadically. They begin striking you, chasing you, or assaulting you. Some have claws, others warts or a contagious disease...  
    You dream you're watching the stars when you feel a sense of losing your footing like you're going to fall into the night sky, nearly falling upward. As your feet leave the ground, the stars dim as a winged form stares at you, then you plummet into the cold ocean. 
    You dream that you're home reading by candlelight when you look up to see your $PET$ contorting; it's head and limbs sprouting second and third heads and limbs. Lightning flashes by the window and a dark monstrous shadow looms across the horizon line. 
    You dream you wake in your bed at home to the sound of the sound water flowing just out of ear shot. As you follow the sound you feel the wriggling of tentacles in your left hand and look down to see a writhing mess of small squid. 
    You dream that you are buried alive in the ground and waken to the cramped darkness, screaming & yelling as you scratch your nails bloody against the coffin lid. The ground outside is filled with burrowing and holes begin to smash open as black tentacles begin to writhe through slowly filling the coffin with their cold, slimy touches as they begin to suffocate you. 
    You dream of floating in a strange, airless void, with a scintillating blue field of stars on one side and a great black void on the other. As you look around, the void begins to grow, enveloping the rest of the sky, and as the last lights wink out you feel your body start to be ripped apart.
    "You dream of floating in a deep, dark ocean, with the only thing in sight a thin tapeworm like creature seemingly floating just below you. It's only as it rises up to devour you that you realize the worm is as wide as a world.", "You dream of awakening in a small cottage. You begin to fall upwards, suffering terrifying vertigo, as everything above you darkens and fades out of existence.", "You're sitting outdoors, with your loved ones around you. The sun is shining and you're having a picnic. Your favorite person says something that makes you laugh. Your laugh is interrupted when you cough. You look down at your hand, and one of your teeth has fallen out. You feel your other teeth grow and wiggle their way out of your gums and fall in your hand. You begin coughing uncontrollably, spraying the ground with teeth. The coughing turns to retching, and you start vomiting teeth. Not just human teeth, but dog teeth, shark teeth, teeth that fit in no sane mouth. They cut your mouth as they come up, and soon you are covered in blood and alien teeth... You continue vomiting teeth until you wake up.", "As the player sits in a semi lit up room, oddly shaped shadow appear from the completely dark corners and slowly creep towards them. When the shadows reach the player, they become physical entities. The shadow from the front-left becomes a two headed cyclops with two sets of insect-like arms with clawed appendages at the end. The one from the front right becomes slime-covered fat creature with a scaly tail lining down its back from the back of it neck and 4 eye stalks on its chubby head. It’s mouth is like that of a goblin shark. The one from the back left becomes a giant fly with two large horns on the sides of its head instead of eyes and a scorpion tail on its back. The one on the back right is a gibbering mouther with hundreds of legs on its underside. These four entities tear the player apart until they wake up.", "You put on your coat and get ready to leave your house. The hat stand is strangely empty. You feel empty; utterly empty. You walk to the $Place_Of_Employment$. Everyone you pass has a hat and is silently screaming.; You pass the silently screaming secretary in their neat fascinator. You reach your desk.There's your hat. A standard homburg. The desk where it sits is cracked and etched as if acid had been oozing from the hat. Your emptiness is being replaced by fear. Dread. Horror. You reach for the hat anyway...", "You awaken on a wooden slab when some cool, heavy liquid cascades onto you. It's hard to move or see, burning your eyes when you open them, but you can vaguely make out a gargantuan humanoid looming above you and skewers your chest and chops of your arm.", "Liquid begins to drown you. You attempt to scream, the salty sweet liquid fills your mouth and drowns out your calls. Strange creatures remove your limbs and then pick up your severed arm and toss it in their mouth, full feeling remaining as it masticates and swallows. As it drops in its stomach you are fully aware of the sensation of your arm's broken bones now being dissolved by the hot acid.", "You're running through a rain forest chasing some brightly colored bird. It's ducking and weaving through the lower canopy, just able to stay 20 feet ahead of you until suddenly it stops. As it turns its head the bird smiles a toothy, orcish grin that wraps around its entire head, motions at you with its beak and laughs like a hyena. Uncountably more sources of laughter flutter in behind and around you as the sky darkens with more and larger wings.", "Your $Parents$ are tucking you into your cradle, speaking in tongues with their eyes closed. When they lean in to kiss you their eyes open, and you see that under the lids are black holes, ringed with teeth.", "You wake up standing on a white pebbly beach before a great black ocean. As you stand with your feet in the surf you feel the tugging of the obsidian water at your legs, far higher than the surf should reach...Looking down, you see barnacles and suckers grabbing up to your knees, dragging you into the briny depths. Fighting kicking and screaming, you see an old man sitting on a big rock on the shore staring at you with gaping empty holes where his eyes once were. As your mouth fills with the inky black water and your vision starts to blur, the old man grins and begins singing an ancient sea shanty that, despite being pulled under the water, you can hear as if you were standing next to him.", "Everyone you ever knew or loved stands in a circle before you and behind you, and stabs you with a weapon, painfully.", "You and a band of soldiers face an army at a bank, trying to cross the lake. You pelt them with arrows, and they fire back. Suddenly it goes silent, and arrow flies out striking the man next to you. Attempting to bring him to your commander, soldiers stream from the bushes behind you, clubbing and slashing everything. You do not know whose who, desperately trying to protect anyone you recognize. One falls upon you, clubbing you with a rock as your arms go weak, unable to fight back.",

Rumors that can be quests
        The Giants were never killed in the giant war, they secretly retreated into their airship and escaped (they actually went up into the clouds like Jack and the beanstalk)
        The king's advisor is a disguised lizardfolk
        Lead helmets stop the government from hearing your thoughts (they also make you go crazy from lead poisoning)
        The public execution of an enemy kingdom's spy was faked with a body double. The real guy is hiding out pretending to be a peasant in one of the outlying towns.
        The birds are spies for the government (not robots though that's crazy)
        the beholder is rumored to have dreamt up the kingdom itself
        The Primordials were never content with being resigned to their own planet, and the increasing amount of dragonborns (only there by sudden portals) points to the fact theyre trying to break back in
        The heir to the throne is actually the son of the general, switched at birth with the true heir, who is living as a peasant, unaware of their lineage.

        The government puts something in the city's water in order to surpress magical abilities in its citizens.
        The bandit raids on towns and villages are orchestrated by smithing guilds in order to increase demand in weapons and armor.

She keeps her identity completely secret and lives a double life with the denizens of the underworld.
        The real king was actually killed years ago by his corrupt advisors; he's been replaced by a doppelganger under the control of said advisors ever since.
        The Gods are a lie. They don't exist. They are really a powerful cabal of spellcasters who rule the world secretly
        Dragons aren't particularly long lived. They only appear so because they grow in power by killing others of their kind. That is why there are so few of them
        Dwarves are the actual builders of this world. They created everything literally from the ground up. Elves are actually 'fallen dwarves' who live so much longer because they have cut themselves off from the earth and stone and no longer return to it when they die.
        Everyone knows there used to be a village there, it was on the trading route. But there is no village there anymore. Nor any sign that one used to be there!

        A local business man is intent on building a legacy of locally-owned farms. He employs only slaves.
        The rise in sea-levels over the past few decades are not a result of the slowly increasing global temperature but rather an increase in gargantuan water-dwelling creatures, whose sheer collective volume is actually displacing the water, making it appear to have risen.
        A local drunk and part time stable-hand claims the recent spate of illness and deaths across the kingdom are the result of tiny invisible creatures attacking us from the inside, and not because the king slept with the wife of a powerful and vindictive mage. Nobody believes him, and his drinking habit grows by the day. His family are concerned and are considering staging an intervention.

        The leaders of the 2 warring nations are in cahoots. The gain profit and influence by perpetuating the war. They have provided propaganda to be taught in schools, they put out flier propaganda on both sides, they use religion.
        The kings throne is actually a mimic that has been enchanted to only allow those of the royal bloodline to sit on it.
        The Queen was never assassinated, it was actually the King. She has been using polymorph and potions to disguise herself as the King.
        The horses used by the guards are actually Kelpie that have been contracted to work for the Kingdom and are feed the prisoners that are 'executed'.
        The reason the Holts Farm never suffers from blights and pests is because they sacrifice an orphan to the creature that lives in their well.
        A rebel group is opposing the prominent church with the overwhelming evidence of their old god.
        When you use teleportation magic, it's not you being teleported. The real you dies, gets disintegrated, and then they make a clone of you in your place.

        Roundearthers are convinced that the world is not a disc and stories of sailors falling over the edge are merely government propaganda.
        The 'Golden Age of Magic' that took place hundreds of years ago actually never took place. The world is much younger than history books show, and everything that happened before a certain point in time was a large-scale illusion placed upon everyone in the kingdom as a cover-up for something else that happenedinfernal
        A clan of changelings have secretly replaced significant individuals of power in order to steer the kingdom to its doom as revenge for somethinginfernal
        The kingdom is surrounded by tall walls that hide everything beyond. No one is allowed out because of the Great War between nations. In reality, there is no Great War. Beyond the walls are unending stretches of desert, ocean, and destroyed land due to some catastrophic event that's hidden from the general populace. But the truth is somewhere out thereinfernal

        A bandit company that was vanquished/scatter years ago never really died, their members just integrated into society and they're enacting a covert, long-term mission to sow chaos in the kingdom. Rumor is, 'My neighbor is a sleeper agent of the long-disbanded thieve's guild!'
        If you go into the Giant's Beard Inn, Soggy Frog Inn, or Quail's Tavern and ask about Rohir Borgenaut, they kick you out. That name means nothing to anyone else in the city. Why?
        Those slaves that the mercenaries sold to the citizenry a few months back are actually just zombies wearing rings of disguise self! People are paying money to bring zombies into their home!
        I saw the court wizard flash a demonic handsign once, as he stood behind the Baron during an address to the people. Who was he trying to signal in the town? What does the signal mean?
        A farmer tells the party that his neighbor was NOT, in fact, killed by orcs three years ago. Orcs go house to house, killing and plundering. My neighbor was violently killed in his own home, and nothing was stolen! no other houses hit! I suspect it was the farmer's guild, they've been squeezing us really hard. I thought they were supposed to help us?!
        The humans in an elf-human city have invented a new device that the elves suspect was purposefully invented to hurt them: the printing press. Using this device, they began mass unlawful arrest of all elves caught in the human quarter, and are producing arrest records much faster than the elf council can keep up with - resulting in a great many innocent elves staying in jail unlawfully for days, weeks, and even months.
        Farmer Randall made a huge fuss a week ago - claims he saw a green dragon eating his sheep. He demanded a retinue of guards come and do a detail. When the guards arrived the following dawn, farmer Randall denies ever making any such claim, and refuses the guards entry to his farm. A few days later, his wife 'left town in the middle of the night' and no one has seen her since. What the hell is going on at farmer Randall's?

        Spawn of Orcus: This entity is the result of an ancient summoning ritual gone wrong in the Underdark. 30ft in diameter, the Spawn of Orcus is an amalgamation of over a hundred humanoid corpses and skulls, fused together in a disgusting mutated formation of perpetually rotting flesh and bone. For centuries it has writhed in agony in a gigantic cavern known as the Sepulchre Sanguinis, where the original ritual once took place. Its agonizing wails can be heard for miles, and its only wish is it to spread pain and suffering to those who cross its path.

It can be released from imprisonment by three kings simultaneously touching the crystal.
        Karthonon: a lich that lives in the feywild and is worshiped by the fairies living near him. Karthonon uses his worshippers as subjects for his alchemichal experiments.

Whether the being succeeds is uncertain. The dark being these wizards see is Karthonon.
        The Weeping King: A ghostly apparition that resides in a lonely, decaying long hall in the wetlands. Tears seem to eternally flood from his eyes and his hellish wail drives men to their knees. When he holds aloft his chipped, rusted sword a host of long dead warriors manifest around him
        Kumbaka: a dragonborn bard that was one of the first dragonborn ever born into existence. Kumbaka spent his life learning as many instruments and languages as possible. One day using his charm and cunning Kumbaka made a bet to a god of magic that if they couldn't kill him before he was done with his preformance tomorrow was over then he would be unable to age and won't die until they are finished counting to infinity. The god of magic agrred to this bet with confidence but on the night of the performance Kumbaka was nowhere to be found. Kumbaka had actually preformed in a different plane of existence which bought him enough time to finish his preformance before he could be found. Kumbaka knows that the god is almost done counting to infinity amd is planning one last show three years from now. In his life Kumbaka had learned to play 13 instruments and can speak 6 different languages. Kumbaka is proud of his accomplishments and is ready to die.
        The Hermit of the Glade: No one knows how old he is, but he has always been there, and will always be there. His house is well maintained, though of low quality. For some reason no one ever bothers him, and few even bother to visit. He is always polite, helpful and could even be called friendly by those who have tried to visit. Perhaps he is some old man blessed/cursed with immortality, or perhaps there’s more to his story.
        The Beast: A boar that has lived in the underdark for 1000 years. He was ordinary boar that grew too large. Throughout the ages hunters have tried to slay The Beast, but none have triumphed. The Beast has only grown, both in size and hatred. His thick hide bristles with the spears and blades of the hunters and warriors it has bested.
        Früdwark The Elder Giant: no one is sure if Früdwark is a storm giant or a separate breed of giant entirely. Früdwark is by far the largest and oldest giant known to giant kind. Früdwark has no concern for other giants, dragons, or mortals and simply wants to be left alone. Früdwark has a distaste for dragons especially because dragons seem to be the creatures that are always trying to pester him the most. Früdwark has been known to make deals with mortals so that they can stop bothering him and so that they can kill dragons who bother him.
        Filtara: the oldest dracolich still alive. Filtara was the creature that had taught mortals to achieve lichdom at the cost of their servitude.

        Ythandr: a pit fiend that owns the endless library which is a huge landmark in the nine layers of hell. The endless library is considered the library with the most books and information within its walls. Those who make too much noise in the library are swiftly dealt with by Ythandr. First time offenders are warned and left with a painful burn mark, second time offenders are taken to an area of the library simply labeled 'pain room'. It's a mystery what happens in the pain room but each offender spends 20 years in it and always leave with the parts of their brain pretaining to memory removed and given back to them in a jar. Ythandr is one of the very few devils that were born before the nine hells existed.
        The Trader: a quiet, strange being who pulls a cart full of strange magical items for no known reason. They wears a cloak that is always oily for some reason, a mask that completely hides their face, and large leather gauntlets that go up to their elbow. They only accepts other magic items of equal value for trade, and their stock is completely random, one day they may have only a +1 dagger, the next they may have multiple +5 vorpal swords. They are immune to all magical effects, including any forms of divination. If a PC asks a god or being with similar power about them, the god/other being will have no clue who they are talking about. They are friendly to the party, but will refuse to leave their cart or reveal any skin no matter what.
        The Poison Tree: The Primal Aspect of Knowledge, both good and ill. Uncovering new information is to be celebrated, even when it brings about ruin. Some scholars believe the tree is purely a metaphor, written about to conceptualize complex ideas in a primitive age; some believe it to be real, and strike out on lifelong journeys to find it and eat of its fruit.
        Eros: Referred to as 'The Mother of Monsters' in common parlance, this entity shares its name with the later goddess of love, though Eros is far more primal. It is love and lust in all of its forms, and its offspring and faithful are hybrids of monsters and humanoid species. Violent and terrible, the Forbidden Plateu of the Cult of Eros is home to rare species of beast and plant life. The very air there is said to corrupt mortals beyond recognition, twisting them into amalgams of man and monster.

Those who have been killed by the hands of The Pig are found with no face and black ooze bubbling from a hole in their chest.
        The Yawning Willow: A sentient tree that speaks via the wind blowing through its leaves. The Yawning Willow is so old that it invented the language of druidic and has taught some of the first druids the ways of nature.
        Rinoir: he uses the body of a human once sworn in pact to Rinoir, now an avatar to him, as a demonic machine that has twelve mechanical arms protruding from the human’s old, withered, and blackened corpse. Rinoir is desperate to find a new host as his current one is getting more and more fragile as each year goes by.
        The Duke of Stone: a 20 foot tall being made of various stones and metals. The Duke of Stone is near impossible to describe due to their alien nature but some defining features are its many eyes and sharp, jagged body (if that even is a body at all). The Duke of Stone is a creature who takes joy in learning of its prey before petrifying them and engulfing their stone body into its horrendous figure. The Duke is always joking about how it 'eats' and 'sleeps' like a fleshbag, thinking of any creature smaller than him as a toy.
        Qpljhyt: an entity made of a pink fleshy substance that forms into a circle. The name of this creature cannot be pronounced by any creature except for gods and powerful aberrant mind sorcerers. Qpljhyt has been around since the creation of the material plane and will only give information to those who he wishes to give information to. Qpljhyt cannot attack but can use a special reaction to force a creature to make a DC 28 intelligence saving throw, on a failed save the creature is reduced to 0 hit points and on a successful save the creature take 30+20d12 force damage. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by Qpljhyt are erased from time and space. Qpljhyt has a hit point total of 4000.
        Talveer: A roughly humanoid figure made of grey living ropes bound together, wearing rough clothing that seems to be made from parts of various clothes and other materials sown together. They wander the wilderness, if encountered by heroes or others with potential, they will offer a strange quest. The rewards will be good, but the consequences of failure morbidly bizarre. Accept the quests at your own peril, follow every letter and you will be rewarded, a single mistake will be worse than death.
        The Night Owl: an immortal being who owns a demiplane where the sun never rises and the party never stops. Those who get trapped on his plane cease to age with the downside of never being able to escape the endless party.
        The Birds: Ancient beings of Shadowfell that seep into the material plane through their disciples. Nobody knows where The Birds came from or what their true intentions are, as each of their followers are given a different set of powers and directives, but they are powerful. Those who know of their existence speak of visions of thousands of voices speaking at once, being in the center of a tornado of black wings, and an overwhelming sense of dread.
        Thornhart: A very old, forgotten god of life and nature, may be offspring of (insert your god of nature). His appearance resembles a massive hart with white fur tinged with green as if moss has been growing over him, with antlers made of interwoven vines covered in blooming flowers of all colors. A rainbow rack, it's called. Once long ago he was worshipped as a god of protection, rewarding those living close with nature. Now all he protects is his own Grove, mostly forgotten by all except the oldest of druids. He is standoffish to an irrational degree towards all but the most reverent of druids.
        Stormpale: A very old, forgotten god of war and death, may be offspring of (insert your god of war). His appearance is a massive falcon (about the size of a young red dragon) whose feathers are so black they seem to drink the light. He appears as though he's a shadow in the sky, or rather, a shadow projected onto the sky. The only part of him that is not inky blackness are his red eyes, which don't so much glow as they seem to reflect light back in a red haze. Seeing him in the sky has long been considered a very ill omen, portending war, famine, or death of some sort. However, at this point, being forgotten for so long, he is simply lonely, and is content to have a conversation with anyone.
        Arachae Cythalia: roughly translated from deep speech meaning queen of spiders, Arachae Cythalia is a spider with an old hags face and human feet on each of its ten spider legs. Arachae Cythalia has been building a web from the deep realm to the material plane and she will soon achieve her goals. Arachae Cythalia believes she deserves to be the goddess of spiders and intents to kill the current god of spiders. Arachae Cythalia gives birth to a freakish human spider hybrid race that has not been seen by anyone in the material plane. The ettercap species is considered a perversion of spiderkin to Arachae Cythalia and plans to cause a mass extinction to all ettercaps.
        Dreamstalker Child: an undead entity that manifests primarily in dreams, travelling from one dreamer to the next. It appears as a young child with an indistinct face that cannot be remembered, wearing a tattered grey linen tunic. If the dreamer reacts with fear or hostility towards the child, it will begin stalking them during waking hours. Small knife cuts will appear on the stalked person's body. If they walk near a dark doorway, they will feel a small hand grab them and try to pull them inside.
        The Golden Thrush: a small, plump bird with large, inquisitive eyes. Its plumage is brilliant gold, with brown spots and a white underbelly. Its song is a sparkling high-pitched trill, audible for miles. It is actually a remnant of the consciousness of an ancient forest spirit. If it witnesses someone damaging the forest or attacking the native creatures therein, it defends its domain by diving at the trespasser at incredible speeds, plunging through their body like a bullet. If fed mistletoe berries, it will grant a boon and safe passage through its forest.
        Warden of Agathys: a large muscular devil with blue skin and horns made of ice as well as a pigs nose. The Warden of Agathys hold the flail of punishment which is a +3 flail that magically causes painful spasms. The Wardens job is to punish sinners who were vile enough to make it into such a deep layer. After doing the same job for three millennia The Warden has perfected the art of torture to a science.
        Duchess of Wasps: a giant wasp with a head set ablaze with purple fire. The Duchess of Wasps can speak telepathically to creatures and loves to feast on mortal flesh. The Duchess of Wasps very rarely allows for deals to be struck with mortals but when she feels generous she allows for them to get power in return for food that her children may eat. The Duchess of Wasps will lay eggs in her victims and wait for them to hatch. Her lair is filled with wasps and corpses of humanoids, goblins, trolls, dragons, beholders, etc. Legends say that The Duchess of Wasps was once a druid that has transformed into a creature as disgusting as her heart, others say she was the first wasp to ever fly, whatever her story is nobody can deny how old and how powerful she is with near impossibly potent venoms, acids, and Psionics capability.
        Epok, Tilin, and Merq: The Planestriders: A trio of Alhoons that travel between planes successfully hiding for decades at a time. Every thirty years, they return to the Material plane to repeat their ritualistic sacrifices to extend their lives. They target weary travelers on quiet secondary roads. The story of these planestriders is thousands of years old.
        Scourge: a giant reptilian beast from a time long before man existed. It resembles a Tyrannosaurus with wings and horns. It can use a sonic roar as a breath weapon and break down fortified walls. It is said any city he visits is depopulated and left in ruins.
        Gnorman, The Gnomish Sythesist Summoner: He's an incredibly old gnome who at this point cant survive outside of his eidolon and is incredibly powerful. He spends most of his time making discount magic gear and supplies for the needy. The eidolon takes the form of a large mass of black tentacles.
        The People's God: A sentient, if simple mind created on accident via the arcane architects when a great ritual tripled the size of their city overnight. The People's God, or 'Ol Watchful, as it's called colloquially, is omniscient within the walls of the city and can be asked questions via prayer, though the answers are vague at best, nonsensical at worst. It's whispered that a band of vigilantes and a handful of neighborhood watches have learned to access it's knowledge in a more precise manner, and will go to extreme lengths to keep that knowledge out of the hands of the law. Many have claimed to see Ol’ Watchful but appearances vary from story to story and usually come from unreliable sources.
        Heart of The Undead: a mass of black flesh and rotten plant matter located in the shadowfell. The Heart will convulse occasionally and create a wave of necrotic energy from its convulsion.

        Yiith?: Long ago. when a cerebrilith devoured the mind of a minor god, its temple home was sealed away, the whole pocket dimension locked for eons and eons in fear of the demon leaking out divine secrets or power into the rest of the world. When the makeshift tomb was finally unsealed, all that was found besides bones and dust was a single sea snail, dull and healthy. It MIGHT be the cerebrilith Yiith, morphed into this inconspicuous form as a disguise or a side-effect of absorbing the god's magic. Either way, the explorers that raided the ancient home knew of its history, and have taken great care to ensure that this possibly-volatile creature stays under lock and key.
        Saurothid: What remains of an extremely powerful fiendish entity that was heavily wounded long ago.

        The Illumin: They are not known to engage with humans openly. But now and then, those who went spelunking or miners trapped in caves found themselves either led out by a mysterious light being. Or sometimes, led deeper in. The stories told around them are often suggestive that when someone becomes trapped in the dark, they measure a person by whether or not they bring light to others. Then choose to appear and lead them to whatever the Illumin wish them to see. Perhaps it is safety or their end. But whether or not the beings truly gauge such things or if they are each with their own whims and choices is not known to mortals. The Illumin themselves are creatures of the dark, deep, and below places. They are often compared to feyfolk or changelings but some scholars have theorized they share things in common with bioluminscent cave mushrooms or spores. They disappear in areas of light, and can shape themselves as they wish. Another more accepted theory is that they are the result of hallucinations and that they do not truly exist.

Those living in its proximity may find themselves falling under its psychic influence and performing strange tasks. The ultimate goal of the unborn creature, as long as if and when the egg hatch, remain unknown.
        Mother Hornwort: Ancient even by hag standards, Mother Hornwort's hunched figure emanates an aura of power.

The gods knew that while they could stop his horrid new form from arising they couldn’t help but watch as the abomination unfolded before their eyes out of morbid curiosity. The forgotten king has been cursed for 500,00 years now and looks like a deformed werewolf, having one hand being larger than the other, a horn protruding from his eye socket, sickly white colored fur, and pure white eyes. The Forgotten King has never transcended into godhood for the other gods refused to allow it. He now waits in his castles ruins waiting for his daughter (who’s been dead for many many centuries) to come back from her coronation as princess (an event that happened when he was still happy).

This artifact becomes more fragile as general worry, doubt, and fear spread across the world.
        Asherl-Khan, The Guilt of Gods - Khan, the former god of glory, was slain and reanimated as this undead husk of a god. Khan's artifact, The Mantle of Glory was also transformed into The Mantle of Guilt which now exhales an impossibly black fog that reanimates the fallen and converts undead into following Asherl-Khan's will. The other gods were too ashamed to face their former friend and thus had Sigil's Lady of Pain seal him away in one of her mazes.
        Voltius the Eternal: the oldest known vampire of the world. His large age and the gigantic quantities of blood he consummed granted him god-like abilities relate to his condition.

        Pam: a frail old human woman who just never seems to die. She has outlived her children, grand children, great grandchildren and so on for so many generations, but the pain of loss just doesn't seem to dissipate. This has left her a bitter old woman. She holds intimate knowledge of ancient societies because, well, she lived there and she often yearns for the 'good old days' when only sorcerers could make fire and magic couldn't be learned by any idiot who could open a book. She has attempted and failed at ending her own life and having it ended for her by provocation, but recently she has altered her strategy in life and is using her knowledge to indugle in a little necromancy. If she won't die, then neither will her great-great-great-great-great-great-grand children. If she succeeds, she will be united with her huge extended, risen again, family.

Regardless of their form, the Walker is always found walking down a road or path, surrounded by golden motes of light. They have never been seen leaving or arriving anywhere. If the Walker is spoken to politely, they will reply and offer to grant the person 'a light to watch their path'. When the person accepts, one of the lights that surround the Walker will start orbiting them instead, and will keep doing so until they die (when it flies off in a straight line, presumably back to the Walker.) If questioned about the direction of their journey or why they have lived so long, they will reply, 'Does the walker choose the path, or the path the walker?'

It has no bowels and everything it devours comes right through it, chewed and dropped from between all tangled sinews and veins that hang from its stump of a neck, all resembling grotesque tentacles and pseudopods. Melezabeth is mostly immobile, sitting atop of the ancient bottomless well, losing all its meals to the void beneath it. It can crawl, albeit very slowly. It can't be satiated, even with the help of its many cultists, which sacrifice countless victims to Melezabeth's all-devouring maw. Its minions suckle black goo from its disguisting arteries, like lambs of an undead goat, which gives them supernatural strength to do Melezabeth's bidding. They say the head has hypnotic abilities and when fought, it will often cannibalize its minions to instantly regenerate portions of health, catching prey with veiny tentacles and shooting nauseating goo from its swollen body.
        The Cottage: Deep in the Far Realm, protected by an unbreakable bubble of force, lies a small, picturesque, thatched country cottage, floating on an floating island of land with a small pasture for two or three sheep, a small wooden shed, and a vegetable garden. Two elderly humans can occasionally be seen, puttering about the garden, milking the sheep, or caring for the cottage in some way. Ancient tomes and beings with such knowledge describe them simply as The Husband and The Wife, but that is largely the entirety of knowledge about them. They, or similar beings, have lived in The Cottage unchanged for millennia. The bubble in which they exist is utterly unbreachable, even by divine power or spells that effect the nature of reality itself, such as Wish. Any attempts to reach the inside of the bubble result in the breacher being hurled from the area with insane speed and force. Anyone attempting to contact the couple through the bubble will be greeted with friendly nods and waves, but no other attempts at communication.

The light temple is filled with light and magic based puzzles. The night temple is filled with dangers and fights taking place in magical darkness. At the end of each, she is sitting upon a throne. Small and frail but radiating with power. In the light, she will answer any three questions you ask, three answers, two truths, and one falsehood. In the dark, she will answer one question per individual, but the answer always rings true, and the asker may not like the answer. After a group leaves her temples, they will not open their doors again for anyone for 1,000 cycles of sun and moon.

        iron scale-mail molded to look like a pangolin’s armour.
        treated textiles tough enough to offer some protection, dyed in abstract patterns.
        mismatched pieces of armour taken off a dozen different bodies on a dozen different battlefields.
        rattling, ill-fitted lorica segmentata.
        roughly-stitched, muddy hides from animals large and small, furry and scaly.
        a breastplate polished to a bright sheen, and poofy brocaded silk sleeves.
        plates of shell and chitin pried from the flanks of man-eating war-beasts.
        a shredded mail hauberk with arrowheads inextricably stuck in its rings.
        a burgonet, jackboots, and boiled leather.
        splinted steel vambraces and greaves, a rusty coat of plates.
        an enamelled crimson cuirass.
        barding meant for a horse, hammered out to fit them.
        lacquered lamellar.
        a cloak reinforced with light metal plates, with chains wrapped around their forearms to help parry.
        leather trousers, hobnailed boots, and woad war-paint.
        an Almain rivet with a couple missing and dented plates.
        mirror armour, its central chest disc molded to resemble an open palm.
        a brigandine coat, its cloth soiled and torn.
        This warrior fights for
        a queen long dead, a country that no longer exists.
        the ecstatic trance they enter in the heat of battle, unmatched by any other pleasure they’ve experienced.
        revenge against the whole of the world.
        just enough pay to get them high.
        the fulfilment of their unconscious deathwish, so that they may join their fallen comrades.
        the perfection of their technique, so that they may teach the next generation of warriors.
        the only god who ever answered their prayers, a bloody and rapacious thing.
        no other reason than it comes easily to them.
        the chance to stare into someone’s eyes as they die.
        an escape from the bonds of civilized society.
        an outlet for their sublimated frustrations.
        a plot of land they dream of retiring to.
        the chance to find an old enemy on the battlefield and finish their feud.
        the sake of accumulating sin to join their damned love in the hereafter.
        a fiery and uncompromising faith.
        the approval of a father no longer able to grant it.
        accolades and trophies.
        the funds to found a warrior’s paradise.
        the satiation of a curse which demands they spill ten drops of guilty blood for every drop of innocent blood they’ve taken, or else suffer unimaginably as their veins smoulder from within.
        the naked truth they believe to be revealed in life-or-death situations.
        DThis warrior stands out on the battlefield
        for their obstinate ferocity. They have never retreated from a battle without being dragged by their companions.
        for their blood-curdling war-shouts.
        for their calm and clear sight even in the thickest fog of war.
        for the elegant execution of their enemies.
        for the technical precision of their fighting.
        for their graceful, dance-like movements.
        for their unpredictable speed.
        for their brutal strength.
        for their numb resistance to pain and wounds.
        for their disrespect to fallen opponents.
        because they seek out the strongest-seeming foes to fight.
        because of their towering height and abnormal reach.
        for the nigh-impassable wall that is their guard.
        for their opportunistic hit-and-run tactics.
        for their impeccable observation of proper battlefield decorum, and fair treatment of prisoners.
        for the way their charismatic presence lends their fellows courage.
        because of the sweet scent of the perfume they douse themself with before every battle.
        for the way they can predict their opponents and plan ten moves in advance.
        for the sheer dumb luck they must have to survive their own clumsiness.
        for their dirty tricks and unflappable wit.
        DWhen this warrior cries out in their sleep they are reliving
        the moment they squandered an entire campaign’s worth of pay on an ill-advised gamble.
        the beatings they suffered at the hands of their mentor.
        when they had to hide among the reeking dead and were trampled beneath them all the same.
        a duel they lost by their overconfidence, and survived only due to cowardice.
        a campaign they marched for so long they forgot the smell of home.
        a rout so total that more were killed by the weight of their fleeing comrades than were on the blades of the enemy.
        a combat fought in tunnels so close you couldn’t swing a sword.
        a battle fought within fading firelight, those at the sputtering edge picked off by blind enemies.
        an ambush when they were caught wading waist-deep through mud.
        a terrible trip they suffered because of the hallucinogenic venom smeared along an enemy’s weapon.
        the moment they realized they were going to live and die by the sword.
        a fight against a monster no mortal weapons could scratch.
        the moment they received a wound whose scar still aches even all these years later.
        the turning point of a battle when those they thought were steadfast allies betrayed them.
        a time they thought they’d found peace fell into chaos once more.
        the loss of their dear love while they were away on campaign.
        the long sickness that wasted away their hard-earned strength.
        the civil schism that turned them against their brother.
        when a priest cursed the warrior with their last breath.
        the moment they sold out their comrades who planned to desert their army.
