        A skull that can speak and remembers it's former life, but can do nothing else.

        A magical vending machine that when a gold is deposited, it creates and gives a 3' wood statue of who ever is standing in front of it. 
        Giant ceramic jars with holes in them for air, and a trickle of water. The jars are the size of houses and magically sedate (and then force into hibernation and then stasis) anyone who enters them in short order. They are a form of larder for keeping sentient creatures alive and fat until thier time to be eaten. 
        A crown that puts the wearer to sleep, but then transforms the world around them into a twisted version of what they are dreaming. The dream ends if the crown is removed. The more powerful lucid dreamers can even interact and live in this dream world, which grows larger the more powerful they are. 
        A porthole of desire. There's some standing stone, with a hole carved out through to the otherside. It shows the observer the greatest desire of a person they are observing through the porthole, examples include a spider subject where everything is covered in webs, and dog and their owner playing together, or an ork burning down the world. 
        A prayer wheel assembly with a near infinite number of runes in an ancient and pre-verbal form of celestial. With it, one might spend a 5th level spell slot and gain a use of a spell similar to Commune with a deity that is within 1 step of the caster's alignment. They may ask up to 8 questions, but the DM must SECRETLY flip a coin each question up to a maximum of 2d4-1 times (max once each question). On tails, the answer she gives must be False or a Lie. If Heads, instead the answer must be True, if cryptic. After the 2d4-1 confusions have occured, then the resulting answers must be True. Using the device more than once per day requires a DC15 Wisdom save, or the user takes a point of exhaustion. 
        An eternally screaming fire skull. It’s not in pain or anything, just bored. Giving it something that might distract it might stop the screaming. 
        A black stone statue of a frog filling a cubic foot, weighing 150 lbs. Expend a spell slot of at least level one. Every flying insect, bug, creepy crawly, and flying vermin of size Tiny or smaller within a 40 foot cube centered on the frog is snatched by shadowy lashing tongues of force. After 1 hour, roll a d6. On a 5 or higher, the item creates 1d3 goodberries. The statue continue snatching insects for 1d4 hours after activation, a higher level spell slot multiplies the duration. Roll again for goodberries after each hour. The frog is capable of attacking swarms as well, dealing 1d6 hp worth of damage to the swarm or single Tiny flying creature within its range of effect every round, for the duration. 
        Orb of Distant Sight: A crystal sphere the size of a basketball, weighing 50 pounds. Spend a 1st level spell slot, and an image of anything located within a 40 foot cube (within line of sight of the orb, and within a maximum range of thirty miles, or the horizon, whichever is closer) is shown, projected within a 10 foot cube adjacent to the orb, as per the spell Silent Image. The image updates in real time. Using a full round action, the area spied upon may be moved up to 40 feet per round, within range, and the Orb's effect lasts for 1d10 minutes. Spending a higher level spell slot multiplies the duration of effect. Additionally, once per day, spend a Level 1 spell slot, and the Orb may be used to project an image in the reverse manner to a point within the same range, as per the spell Silent Image for 1d10 rounds. Higher level spell slots multiply the duratiom of this effect. Using the orb in this manner prevents its use for any other purpose for a full 8 hours. 
        Altar of Imbuement: A smoked boxwood altar three feet to a side, with fine ivory handles wrapped in gold wire and decorated with cabochons of Onyx and Amber. A fine golden chalice is mounted inside the altar. Place a magical item that has at least 1 charge remaining, expend a divine spell slot of at least level 1, and pray for 8 hours; roll a d6, on a 5 or higher the item will regain 1 charge (up to a maximum of 3 charges in a 1 month period, or 6 charges per year, whichever happens sooner). Spending a higher level spell slot reduces the required d6 roll, becoming automatic when a 6th level divine spell is expended. 
        The Burning Bell: A courtroom with a sinister looking, large-sized black-iron bell (with no clapper) with adamantine bands is mounted six feet above the floor in a central position. The bell weighs over 200,000 pounds and is twenty feet tall and ten feet across at the base. When rung, it peals at B♭-1 (14.5 Hz) and can be heard for up to 10 miles. While painfully loud, a strange property of the amphitheater is that it protects those inside it from the bulk of hearing damage from the bell's peal. A marble dais is built directly beneath the bell, while a second (more ornately carved) is nearby. The sound of the bell is almost completely muted while standing on either dias. The courtroom is shaped like an amphitheater, with rising levels of seating behind the second dias. The bell (and surrounding temple courtroom) is covered with bas-releif pictoglyphs in a forgotten tongue, the glyphs demonstrate a man standing burning beneath the bell, while those surrounding fall to thier knees. Spend a spell slot of at least third level, and the bell peals, sustaining itself for 3d6 minutes, a higher level spellslot multiplies the length of this effect. While active, anyone hearing the bell (including those on the dais) is under the effects of the spell Zone of Truth. Attempting to lie causes physical pain (and potentially damage) that increases to a maximum beneath the bell. Within the first d6 minutes, the Will DC beneath the bell is equal to the 16+caster's proficiency bonus. This decreases by 1 for every d6 minutes or 100 feet of distance (to a minimum of DC10). Those who lie while beneath the bell suffer 3d6 Sonic damage and 3d6 fire damage (reduced by 1d6 for every 10 feet of distance or d6 minutes, to a minimum of 2 sonic and 2 fire). They may attempt a CON save equal to the same DC (as to lie) to only suffer half damage. 
        Goblets of Shattering: A set of at least seven fragile musical crystal goblets. Up to once per hour, when all are played at once, it casts the spell Shatter against targets within range. Roll a d6. On a 1, this causes one of the goblets to break as well, but the damage dealt is doubled. If all the goblets are broken, the magical set no longer functions. 
        The Whispering Pillars: A set of 60 foot tall pillars, intricately carved. Anyone seated at the top of a pillar suffer the following effects (during) and up to 1d6 hours after leaving: Blinded (CON DC15 resist), Silence (WILL DC15 resist), and Slow (DEX DC15 resist). While seated at the top of the pillar, the creature gains ADV on sound based Perception checks and a +5 bonus, being able to hear even a whisper up to ten miles away, as if they were right next to the whisperer. Additionally, once per eight hours, the listener may use the effect of the spell Detect Thoughts against one creature they perceive within 1d6 miles. 
        A heavy gold plated metal washtub weighing 300 pounds. Six feet long, three feet across and three feet deep. When mostly filled with clean warm water, any object or creature placed within the tub is cleansed as per the spell Prestidigitation. It also smells strongly of either rosewater, jasmine, orange blossom, mint, smoked sausage/bacon/steak, sandalwood, patchouli, or lavender (roll a d8), for up to one hour. 
        A Giant Pendulum in a Garguantuan Grandfather Clock: Movement speed in the room is doubled, but all creatures in the room are under the effects of Slow (Will DC 15, resist at start of each round) or Haste (Will DC 15, resist at start of round), determined by a coinflip for each creature upon entering the area, or at the start of thier turn. 
        A fancy room with a very accurate dollhouse inside that creates dolls of anyone or anything within 100 feet. Interacting with the dolls or furniture moves and affects their counterparts as well, and againstvliving creatures the effect is like that of a Voodoo doll (Will/Str/Con DC 15 to resist at the start of the round. Resist three rounds and you are immune to the effect until your next long rest.) Each round, the contents of the house reflect reality. Damaging or destroying the dollhouse deals an equal amount of damage to all within range. 
   
    mystic grimoires
        This grimoire
        is bound with a cover made from human teeth and nails.
        was inked with the discoloured blood of inhuman beasts.
        is a mere fragment of a greater work, all that could be preserved from a purge.
        is, or has become, a living creature. Its pages pulse with a faint heartbeat, and absorb unwary worms for sustenance.
        has synaesthetic text, words that are smelled or felt more than read.
        changes its exact wording each time it’s read.
        always appears in the dreams of those who’ve read it before, where it remains perfectly legible.
        will pluck at the strings of fate to place itself in the possession of ambitious sorts if it’s sealed away for too long.
        is a glass puzzlebox which projects its text when a light is shone through it. Rearranging it reveals another segment of text.
        has increasingly deranged marginalia scribbled in a dozen different hands in its open spaces.
        makes you speak its words aloud as you read it, someone else’s voice coming from your throat.
        appears to be written in gibberish until you add your signature to the many that fill its otherwise blank front page.
        glows with a sickly light, so that it is legible even in total darkness.
        seems fated to injure its readers. One can scarcely turn a page without getting a papercut.
        has a section of actual human spine as its spine.
        is fireproof, and can only be read in full by immolating it.
        causes its reader’s eyes to bleed. Reading it too much inflicts blindness, as readers become unable to see anything but the grimoire.
        is a stack of clay tablets. There’s more tablets in the stack than it seems there should be based on its size and weight, and any tablets removed or destroyed inexplicably return to the stack.
        heals any damage done to it, leaving a mottled scar.
        is written in a code that takes sustained effort to crack. Without this effort, it seems to be a mundane cookbook.
        DThis grimoire was written
        by a doomed poet who dove deep into a mystery cult for inspiration.
        by a scholar who claimed to have tapped into the Akashic Records, where all knowledge is stored.
        by a popular medium while in a trance, shortly before their mysterious disappearance.
        by a priest who became obsessed with dubious apocrypha.
        by an unknown authour. It simply appeared in history one day.
        by an entire village, one page to a person, before they walked together into the night, never to be seen again.
        by a thousand deranged monkeys.
        by the head doctor of an asylum, based on the rantings of their patients.
        by the hands of an infamous thief, after they were cut off as punishment.
        by a historian based on their collated research on several lost civilizations.
        by a child who claimed to have been inspired by their imaginary friend.
        some time in the future. What you might find of it now is an imperfect, backwards copy anticipating its own original.
        shamefully, by a secret heresiarch.
        apparently long before any other example of written language.
        by a self-proclaimed prophet who claimed to have received its text in a god-granted vision.
        by a hermit best known for throwing their feces at visitors.
        by a jaded noble who brought ruin to their estate in pursuit of limit-experiences.
        by a professor and their closest students, who barricaded their university and slaughtered the rest of the inhabitants.
        as a bowdlerization of a yet more dreadful tome.
        by the hands of the true creator of the world, allegedly.
        DThe lore which this grimoire contains
        is rituals to summon demons, though not to control or banish them.
        is how to mix potions which induce mutation.
        is the secret names of angels, which allow them to be bound against their will.
        is the location of a dormant undead army and the means to command it.
        is how to open portals to inchoate realms beyond the conventional cosmos.
        is knowledge of how to enslave human souls to animate fell golems.
        is rituals to transform oneself into a kind of intelligent undead: a vampire, a ghoul, a lich, and stranger sorts besides.
        is a tragically flawed ritual to resurrect the dead.
        is spells to cook together living things into hybrid monsters.
        is rites to commune with a banished and vengeful divinity.
        is a rite to shuck one’s own dooms, curses, and misfortunes onto a more innocent scapegoat.
        describes how to slip one’s soul away from just punishment in the hereafter, or damn another to far worse than they deserve.
        is rituals to transfer your mind into another’s body, consuming their self in the process, or to splinter off pieces of your mind to fester and infect another’s.
        is how to call up plagues, but not how to cure them.
        is the method to create a sphere of annihilation.
        can be used to immanentize the eschaton.
        is knowledge of how to remove human organs and replace them with empowering alien substitutes.
        is how to steal life-force from others to enhance and extend one’s own.
        is charms to bend the minds of others.
        is how to steal and pervert divine magic.
        DThis grimoire was forbidden
        so that its temptation to prospective seekers would be increased.
        not for the lore it contained, but rather for its satirical preface which offended a political leader.
        because hidden in its text is a memetic weapon that drives readers mad.
        because its cover forms a seal that unleashes a malign spirit while it is open.
        because it’s a failed attempt at a phylactery, and so its writer(s)’s ghost(s) can haunt anyone who’s read it.
        because it was used to facilitate an atrocity.
        due to the blasphemous ideas its text promulgates.
        because none of its lore is accurate, and is in fact a trick for an even darker purpose.
        because reading it is a spiritual hazard that dooms one’s soul to a truly unfortunate afterlife.
        because it’s proof of the limits of safe, sane magic.
        because of the machinations of a sorcerer who thought it plagiarized their own work.
        because it was once the key element in a plot to hasten the apocalypse.
        because the lore it contains could destabilize the natural order of things.
        because prophecy held that great evil would follow if it were not kept out of sight of perusing eyes.
        because the gods have a habit of smiting indiscriminately around it.
        by a tyrant who didn’t want anyone else to be able to tap its power.
        due to popular demand.
        because as it’s read it refines and expands on itself by reading in turn the minds of its readers.
        because the publishing house that owns the rights to it gets violently litigious if there’s any chance it might be copied.
        as an excuse to seize it for an authority’s use.

        30	The Furrowed Brow: Esmeralda Turnbottom's mother made wards, and her mother made wards, and her mother made wards... And Esme has never been one to spoil a good tradition. The wares range from mundane (a pendant against forgetfulness, carved from gingko bark) to the specialized (ground cat's tooth to drive off harpies). Once a year, she closes up shop for a much deserved vacation, and returns with an armful of oddly specific wards.

        35	The Amazing Omar's Shop of Curiosities: Omar, a flamboyantly dressed merchant waves, you over to his display wagon to view his wears.

Ketterman typically sells to the upper class, but as long as you can pay he's more than willing to work with just about any customer. But here's the catch: Ketterman is actually an accomplished diviner as well. Every time he carves an eye into his stonework he can use those eyes to scry through at any time. Ketterman uses his vast network of eyes to spy on anyone within their gaze, and if he comes across something particularly noteworthy he sells that knowledge to the highest bidder, or uses it as leverage for blackmail under his assumed alias of 'The Emerald Pool' (because his eyes are green). Ketterman has been operating for almost two decades now, and his work has traveled far across the land. Odds are his stone eyes have seen something you didn't want to be seen. So tell me friend; what are you hiding? (u/Kami-Kahzy)

        Peg-leg. This NPC has one wooden leg, just like the classic pirate captains used to have.

        Natural Born Trader. This NPC tries to sell you everything it can. 'See this chair? It’s yours for just two gold pieces! See this flower? Yours for a piece of silver, it’s really rare! See my wife/husband? It’s yours for…'
        Not a care in the world. This NPC is unbelievably happy. They only see the good in life and are extremely positive.

        What’s this for? This NPC doesn’t use his left arm. He/She just leaves it hanging, doing nothing. There’s nothing wrong with the arm, the NPC just doesn’t use it at all. For nothing.
        Classic Tammy. This NPC has underwear visible above his or her pants. It’s not that his/her pants are really low, but his/her underwear is just really high. Roll a d4 to determine the state of the underwear, Clean, nothing special, Dirty and torn, Obviously way too tight, Very sexy.

        Weirdest Mutton Chops Ever. This NPC, whether it’s a he or a she doesn’t matter, has the weirdest mutton chops anyone has ever seen. They are a different color than the rest of his/her hair and they are somehow intricately braided.
        Final Countdown. This NPC counts down after each conversation. The NPC has a conversation with the party, and when they or the NPC leave, the NPC utters: 73. When the party then asks: 'What was that?' The NPC will claim to not know what they are talking about, then leaves again saying: 72. Good luck roleplaying this one.
        Grumpy face. This NPC has a face that says: 'I hate everything. I hate hating everything.' Basically, his or her face looks incredibly pissed off all the time, even though he or she might be very happy.

        To be or not to be. This NPC is desperately trying to become an actor/actress. He/She is not very good at it though. In normal conversations this NPC sounds like he or she is talking on stage, it sounds very fake and extremely articulated.

        Shaving Sucks. This NPC is very bad at shaving. If it’s a man, he has a lot of small cuts on his face. With a successful DC8 perception or insight check it’s pretty clear that they are the result of terrible shaving. If the NPC is a woman, it is almost the same, but instead the cuts are located on her legs (Yes, even in D&D some women shave their legs. Trust me!).
        Wild Accuser. This NPC accuses everyone he talks to of minor crimes, like littering, or making too much noise.
        Am I hearing this right? This NPC mishears almost everything. He/She thinks he/she heard everything right, and continues the conversation on whatever subject he/she thinks he/she heard. For example: 'Can you tell us where the Inn is?' The NPC hears: 'Can you tell us where Theon is?' And responds with: 'I have no idea who that is, I’m sorry!' If you still want the NPC to be helpful, make him/her understand every sentence correctly when he/she hears them a second time.
        Puppet Pal. This NPC always has a wooden puppet with him/her. Whatever his relationship with this puppet is, is up to you as a DM. Good luck!
        Bless you! This NPC has a permanent cold. Always a runny nose and sneezing all the time.

        Permanent Ink. This NPC has a large tattoo of an animal’s head on their neck. If you can’t think of an animal yourself then it’s a chicken’s head.
        Loading, please wait. This NPC needs some time processing conversations. Whenever you talk to him/her, it takes them 1d6 + 5 full seconds to respond. Even if it’s a short and simple question.
        Whispering guide. This NPC has a small creature hidden in their hair that whispers advice and insight into their ear. The creature is a Sprite, which has the ability to turn invisible and sense if anyone is lying by touching them.
        My brother, there art thou! This NPC is convinced that one of the party members is their long lost brother or sister. He or she will not be easily convinced of the contrary.

        Lilac and Gooseberries. This NPC smells like lilac and gooseberries, a particular smell that might be familiar to some of the players.
        Mouthful. This NPC always has something in his/her mouth. It could be food… but they never swallow. And it's too big to be chewing gum. It makes this NPC very hard to understand.
        The Narrator. This NPC always speaks about him or herself in the third person, and he or she narrates everything that happens in their vicinity.
        Narcissist. This NPC is always holding a mirror, looking at him or herself while blowing kisses and winking. It looks away now and then to look at the party but he or she mostly looks at themselves.
        Needlessly Shifty. This NPC comes across as very shifty. He or she laughs sneakily after answering questions or making deals, like he or she is hiding something. But they aren't, it's just a weird mannerism they were born with.
        Fungal infection. This NPC has a small growth of blue green fungus on one of their cheeks. Under close scrutiny the fungus almost seems to pulsate with every heartbeat.
        Squinter. This NPC squints their eyes at the party. It looks like he/she needs a pair of glasses.
        Mad hatter. This NPC wears a really long, really silly pointy hat. It's over 3 feet (1 meter) tall, made up of different kinds of materials and colors. Possible explanation for why the NPC is wearing it: 1. Their kid made it for them and now they are pretty much obligated to wear it. 2. They made it themselves because they believe it will make them a really powerful wizard. 3. It is a cursed hat that can't be removed and someone put it on their head while they were sleeping.
        Sketch artist. This NPC is scribbling on a piece of paper while he or she is talking to the party. After a while they proudly show the sketch they made of one of the party members. Roll 1d6/2 to see how good this NPC is. Very, very bad. Extremely average. Very, very good.
        Want a cookie? This NPC bakes their own cookies and offers to anyone and everyone to try. Roll 1d6/2 to determine the quality. Terrible, bitter and is that a hair? Average, OK cookies. These are amazing, crunchy, sweet and something you can't quite put your finger on but it's awesome.
        Juggler. This NPC is an excellent juggler and will juggle everytime he or she has two or more items in his or her hands. Their limit is 1d6 + 3 items at once.
    doggos
        Volmusian Ember Hair - A breed derived from fire elemental stock, bred by druids as attack animals. Fiery red hair, maned, with a sturdy frame and short snout. 1d3 Fire damage/round if within 5ft and the dog dislikes you.
        Mutt of Tindalos - Possessed of the blood of creatures which exist outside of space-time; this canine does not move, it simply stutters & teleports up to 40ft in a round instead. They are off-putting creatures, emaciated and long-limbed with greenish-grey fur.
        Hemohound - Descended from the hounds owned by vampires. Sable-furred, with crimson eyes and bodies built for pursuit. Hemohounds feed on blood, and biting living creatures heals them. Each successful bite restores 1 HP to the dog.
        Cerberusid - Smuggled out from Hades itself, these stocky, well-muscled and snub nosed dogs have multiple heads for observing the comings and goings of the dead. Advantage on anything to do with multi-tasking or perception. Roll 1d6 - 1-3: 2 heads, 4-6: 3 heads.
        Dorician Pale Dog - Developed by fakirs for the purposes of curing diseases, these wane and mangy beasts are capable of taking diseases into themselves by licking the afflicted and transferring them to another through the means of coughing or sneezing fits.
        Dolchean Mole-hound - A strange breed of canine developed by dwarves to help them guard their subterranean farms. Mole-hounds have short white fur, huge reflective eyes, and massive paws. These dogs can burrow and dig at half the speed at which they can run.
        Sivardian Chaser - These huge, grey-furred, and wolf like dogs were bred by Hobgoblins to keep pace with and flush out their traditional Centaur rivals. Chasers move 20ft faster a round than a typical canine.
        Phantom Cur - Cultivated from canines repeatedly revived through necromantic means, these eerie hounds outwardly seem like normal members of their species, but they often go minutes without breathing or days without blinking. Their own proximity to death allows them to sense and affect incorporeal beings.
        Spell Terrier - Developed by generations of spell-casters to be the ideal Familiar, spell terriers are small enough to be carried on one's person and are possessed of luxurious hair suitable for petting. Spell Terriers can identify and retrieve spell components and magical items.
        Witcher Spaniel - A dog bred by mage-hunters to help them identify their targets. These spaniels are tall and long-bodied, with short dark coats and pointed features. Witchers can sense the presence of magic, and will growl when a spell is used in their presence.
        Ceirwannian Hunting Hound - Graceful and sleek of profile, these shaggy-haired hunting dogs are a traditional companion of elvish rangers, and are used to help their owners harry prey. Ceirwannians gain advantage on all rolls relating to stealth or ambush.
        Splay-toed Goblin Dog - Long of limb and short-furred with large digit pads, these dogs are used by Goblins as both draft and riding animals. Their feet allow them to easily bound and scurry up the broken terrain and caves in which their masters make their homes. Splay-toes ignore the effects of difficult terrain and climb half as their movement speed.
        Chardonian Water Spaniel - Savior of pirates and sailors the world over, Chardonian are mid-sized short-haired dogs which come in a variety of blues. Fiercely loyal, these dogs are trained to retrieve folk thrown overboard during sea voyages. Chardonian have been interbred with water elementals, and they may breathe underwater and swim as quickly as they run.
        Drowish Oozehound - Bizarre and terrifying creatures designed by the dark elves as guardians for their slave pens. These beasts tend towards bright and playful personalities, their fur replaced by semi-translucent globules of tar like ichor. A bite (or nuzzle) from an Oozehound necessitates a strength check to escape.
        Saoghal Cultivated Dog - A servant dog bred by the nobility to be a gentleman's best friend, these beautiful beasts move with the poise and elegance of an aristocrat. Their long fur is kinked into tight spools which must be brushed daily to keep from knotting. Saoghals are incredibly intelligent, watching those that treat with their owners carefully, barking or growling when they suspect that lies are being told.
        Doppeldachshund - Originally the product of a now obscure and likely mad arch-mage, this breed of dog is now chiefly treasured by cheap side shows and thieves. Doppeldachshund are able to briefly alter their form into that of other animals of their own approximate size. They can maintain an alternate form for only ten minutes before shifting back.
        Corantinian War Dog - Chosen from the fiercest and largest stock by generations of crusaders to foster a gargantuan canine which rivals a small pony in size. Corantinians have thick coats of white fur which braid themselves into thick protective cords as the dog matures. Corantinians have an extra Hit Die than a typical canine.
        Troll-blooded Laika - This particular land race was developed by goblinoid tribes to aid them in their hunts and raids. Interbred with regenerating creatures, these dogs are utterly fearless and unflinchingly loyal. They are a mid-sized breed and of average build, but they are terribly ugly, covered in patches of uneven and wart-ridden fur. Troll-blooded Laika regenerate 1/HP a turn. Laika eat double the amount of a typical dog.
        Poison Dart Dog - Inspired by the similarly named amphibian, a group of shaman deep within the jungles of Auyyuah have bred a line of canines capable of producing and expelling poisons. These dogs can at will exude a class 'M' poison. They are hairless and sleek creatures, with slick patches where the poison naturally pools.
        Platinum Retreiver - An offshoot of common hunting dogs, these somewhat dopey and friendly beasts can detect the presence of precious metals up to 60' away.

                You hear people arguing loudly, a small crowd is gathering on the side of the road around them. You see two guards screaming at a small, balding dwarf in a dirty white shirt. The dwarf seems very apologetic. After a while, the guards simply push him to the ground and walk away. The dwarf is a private investigator. He messed up a big case and created problems for the guards. He’s not bad at his job, he says. If given an opportunity, and fair pay, he’s eager to prove he’s a capable hound.
                The road opens up as if it was a colossal mouth, dozens of meters long. Inside, instead of dirt and rocks, its inside is fleshy and squirmy. A few passersby and a cart with horses fall inside, their screaming doesn’t last long. The road closes, trembles, you hear a brutal crunching and crushing and squishing, then it opens up again.
                As you walk through the city at night, you see a wobbling light coming towards you. It’s a lantern bearer, accompanying someone. From a distance, they appear to be regular folks, but as you get close, an unnerving sensation starts crawling up your skin. The one carrying the lantern is hunched forward and dressed in patched-up rags that drag on the ground. The other one seems like a nobleman, his black jacket has golden buttons and trimmings, he’s wearing a top hat and has a walking stick. When they are closer, the two stop, and you hear the well-dressed man tell the other 'Wait here, I’ll have a quick snack before we go.' Then he starts walking towards you.
                A runaway carriage is rushing towards you, there is no driver, the horses seem in a frenzy, neighing and frothing. As it gets closer, you notice a small, impish creature is attached to one of the horses, sinking its claws in its flesh.
                A young gnome lady is pushing a small cart filled with candles, crying 'buy a light, buy a light for the night, good sirs.' As she gets close, she looks at you, and you see wax dripping from her eyes. 'A candle to light the way,' she says, as she overthrows the cart. Melted wax floods out, streaming around you, boiling, burning your skin, but you feel something else, twisted, deep, burning away at your mind. 'A light to find your way in the dim abyss of truth, good sir. A candle for the demented halls of the mortal mind.'
                A group of laughing kids rushes through your group, some bumping into you. They don’t steal anything, instead, they put something in your pocket: a shiny, red gem, as large as a chicken egg. A few seconds later, a large minotaur wielding an oversized butcher knife turns the corner, bloodshot eyes, foaming. 'I can feel you have it, you swines!' He screams 'I will butcher you like the thieving pigs you are and dig my gem out of your carcasses.'
                A procession of rats carrying around the town insignia walks through the street. Created by an experiment from the local magical academy, these intelligent rats escaped years ago and have formed an enclave within the city.
                Today is a local festivity. Wagons with masked people playing instruments go through the city, while the people in the crowd throw fruit at each other. At the end of the day, sometimes, spirits of the dead appear for a few hours to visit their families and dine with them.
                The players pass in front of a ruined building in the middle of town. Broken walls, grass everywhere, cobwebs and graffiti feel really out of place, surrounded by regular, well-kept houses. It’s a desecrated church. Its cult abandoned it a long time ago after some horrible thing happened in it, and the church isn’t allowed to demolish, fix or repurpose it, since it technically belongs to the church, so it lies abandoned despite being prime real estate, left to the weather, the homeless and animals.
                The players hear screaming in the distance. They turn a corner, and the street is occupied by two large groups of people, some dressed in green and red, others in blue and yellow. They are beating each other, it’s a huge brawl that occupies most of the street. Around them, more people are cheering, waving flags and throwing flowers. Two families have been rivals for a long time, but over the centuries it has become more tradition than real hate. Now, they have an annual brawl where they pummel each other before going to eat together.
                A store owners helped a druid, and in exchange, he was blessed, now animals love him. As a result, the entire street around his house is filled with wild animals just hanging around: barking dogs, scuttling rats, meowing cats, insects, birds. Poop and fur everywhere.
                The players notice something peering at them from a rooftop. An enormous humanoid covered in rags and chain, its face a grey, expressionless mask with burning red eyes. It looks at them for a few, extremely uncomfortable seconds, then pulls back and disappears.
                A group of kids rushes in front of the players, laughing and kicking a ball of raw leather, they turn a corner and disappear. A few moments later, the same kids pass again. Then a third time, always in the same direction. They aren’t going back and forth, they are repeating. The fourth time, someone that looks identical to the player to the smallest detail is running and playing with the kids.
                In the middle of the night, one of the players wakes up. Something warm is dripping on them. There is an eviscerated pig carcass hanging right over their bed, dripping blood. Other severed animal parts covered in fresh blood surround their bed. Everything is warm and slippery.
                A player wakes up in the middle of the night, something is crawling on their back. Something tiny, but fast. As they try and fail to grab it, from below the sheets, something grabs their foot.
                The players are casually walking through town, when they notice people are staring at them, pointing and laughing. They realize all of their clothes and equipment have, somehow, been switched around. Nobody is wearing their own clothes, and they look ridicolous. Nobody has their own weapon at hand. None of them noticed it happening.

        keep/stronghold encounters
            An old woman goes around, knocking at people’s doors in the middle of night. If welcomed, she leaves peacefully. If not given hospitality, she curses the homeowners in bizarre ways, such as 'you’ll be a beast and your family will be turned into cutlery until someone falls in love with you.' The peasants are scared of this clearly insane witch wandering the land, and beg the players to stop her.
            The keep was build on top of an old dwarven cemetery. Every new moon, the dead rise and a bunch of short skeletons and ghosts attack the keep cantina. They break barrels of wine and drink the content, devour every plucked chicken and duck in the kitchen and cause mayhem.
            A new group of adventurers has just started their career in town, but they're murderhobos and have been doing a lot of damage.
            Two families have been enemies for generations. The youngest members of the two, young and innocent, had fallen in love, but their families didn't allow them to be together. As a result, they committed suicide together. Then, they came back as undeads and now haunt the lands of their families.
            Two families have been friends for generations, but two of the youngest members, barely adults, hate each other and challenge each other to violent duels. Sooner or later one of them will kill the other, or they could both die, and nobody wants that to happen
            A local mafia has been asking the locals to pay protection money and attacking the people that refuse. Problem is, the mafia actually does protect the people, and their private militia is pretty efficient. A lot of locals support them.
            A nearby goblin tribe has been encroaching on the players land. The goblins seem to be running away from something, but the farmers don't care. They just want the monsters out of their land.
            A nearby goblin tribe has been encroaching on the players land. The goblins seem to be running towards something, in a violent frenzy, trampling over any obstacle, as if attracted by a siren's call that nobody else hears.
            A nearby goblin tribe has been encroaching on the players land. The goblins say they were promised a portion of land by the previous lord, in exchange for 20 barrels of a rare goblin ale.
            Local sheep have gained sentience and refuse to be raised like animals. They have organized themselves in a commune and demand more rights and their own land where they can live in peace.
            There is a cave below the keep where enormous fungi grow. One day, they start growing outside, covering the keep walls and doors, infecting trees and animals.
            A group of devils appears in the backyard, they start taking measurements of the keep. When confronted, they say that the land belongs to them. They have a contract: The land was sold to them ten thousand years before, by the people owning it back then. From their point of view, it’s legally theirs, and the players have ten minutes to screw off before they get evicted.
            A drunken giant walks by, stumbling in confusion. He crawls inside the keep and falls asleep in the courtyard, blocking it.
            Three hundred years ago, a great hero was born in the keep, and pilgrims come from all over to visit. They don’t care for locked doors or local laws, and often they will steal things as souvenirs. Sometimes precious things, but often they will take curtains, pieces of furniture, cutlery, shoes, socks.
            A ghost haunts the castle. He was the castle owner, centuries before. The ghost spends his days getting drunk and harassing people in the open. Shouldn’t he, like, rattle chains and scream in the night? Well, he didn’t get a how-to-ghost pamphlet when he died, so excuse him if he’s not haunting in the 'proper' way. In the end, he’s a friendly guy, just kind of an asshole.
            A summoning went wrong, and the demon spirit got stuck in the piano in the music room. You can play it normally if you’re good, but If you hit the wrong note, the keys will bite your fingers. On a positive note, it never needs tuning. Just to be fed twice a week.
            A summoning went wrong, and a celestial spirit got stuck in a door. Now, it won’t let anyone through unless they prove to be worthy. The door takes its position very seriously and is pretty obnoxious.
            A powerful vampire lived in the castle, centuries ago, but it got destroyed by hunters. Or, nearly destroyed. The vampire is still alive, but it’s only a head, too weak to regenerate. It’s now kept inside a glass casing as decoration on a desk. You can talk with it, it’s a pretty intelligent head. It could, potentially, get its powers back by drinking blood, and tries to trick people into feeding it.
            There is an imposing statue in the courtyard, a hero fighting various monsters. On every full moon night, they animate, the monsters spread around the keep and the hero chases them down.
            There is a deep well in the back of the keep. It’s ancient, and nobody knows how deep it goes. The water in it causes hallucinations
            There is an empty room in the keep. If you try to put furniture in it, as soon as the room is empty, the doors will slam close, then, a terrible grinding sound will come out of it for a few minutes. When it’s done, the doors will open and the room will be empty again.
            There is a tower in the keep that is much older than the rest. The servants are scared of it, they talk of a cloaked figure with a lantern walking around it at night, and strange noises.
            A druid keeps intruding in the garden. He has very strong opinions on how the rest of the garden should be cultivated, the right way to prune, colour-coordination of flowers etc. and will harass and even attack the gardener if they disagree.
            A tree in the garden is inhabited by a dryad. She is extremely charismatic and a lot of peasants are friend with her, she gives advice, healing herbs and concoctions and farming tips. Some are starting to think she would be a pretty good town leader, even better than the players…
            Filth and garbage fall from the sky and over the keep. Half-eaten bones, poop, rotten fruit, it’s gross. Nobody knows where exactly they come from.
            At night, terrifying figures wander the village. They wear animals heads, or maybe they are half-animals, nobody knows but the peasants are terrified.
            A farmer’s field is become sentient and are attacking people. Humanoids made of tangled tomatoes, pumpkins ogres, zucchini knights, cabbage rangers and rice warlocks.
            A bizarre creature appears in the castle, a tangle of feathers and claws, beaks and tails and eggs and horns. It flies around for a while, breaking things and hurting people, then it blinks away and appears in another room, then again and again.
            A section of the castle is on fire, but it doesn’t seem to be spreading.
            There is a door that leads nowhere, it simply has a wall behind it. Sometimes, it opens and people walk out of it, confused foreigners from distant lands. Nobody has ever been able to use it to go back.
            A gang of kids and fairies is going around the village breaking windows, turning carts, liftings skirts and generally being annoying. Nobody has been able to catch them, thanks to the fairies magic.
            A priestess wants to open a chapel in the keep. She is extremely aggressive and self-righteous, but pretty good at divine magic.
            A wizard wants a laboratory in the keep, where nobody’s gonna annoy him about safety regulations or so-called 'crimes against nature', but he can pay very well.
            A neighbouring lord is visiting the keep. The man is wealthy and well-connected. He’s accompanied his daughter, who is independent and rebellious, and wants to become a ranger. The lord would be grateful to anyone that changed his daughter’s mind, and the daughter would be grateful to anyone that helped her escape.
            A neighbouring lord is visiting the keep. The man is too old to care, hates etiquette and loves parties. He’s accompanied his daughter, who hates poor people and fun and wants to uphold traditions. The lord will be grateful to anyone able to make his daughter loosen up, and the daughter will reward anyone that will allow her to replace her dad.
            A neighbouring lord is visiting the keep with his daughter. They are both raging assholes that look at every other person like filth, but they are part of a powerful and connected family.
            A neighbouring lord is visiting the keep with his daughter, they are both party animals with a habit of going too far and causing serious damages and starting fires, but they’re a lot of fun.
            No neighbouring lord is visiting the keep. That is bad for diplomacy, the players need to make their land more appealing, or they won’t be taken seriously and remain isolated.
            A hole opens in the middle of town, and a bunch of drow flood out. They’re refugees, running away from mind flayer slavers. They were forced to escape to the surface or die, and are out of options. If the players don’t shelter them, they will all die. Most of them are civilians. Many peasants are against it, and think its’ a trap, or that they deserve to die. The mind flayers are coming.
            A hole opens in the middle of town, and a bunch of slugs flood out. They crawl over people and bury in their brains. There is panic, but the 'infected' people seem fine, more or less. There is no immediate effect, and nobody is sure who or how many were infected.
            A hole opens in the middle of town and a blinding light floods out. Some people, as in a trance, start walking inside it and never come out. Every day more people go in the hole.
            An artist has settled in the village. Her art pieces are very, very good, but also disturbing, and seem to reveal people’s secret. They cause fights, start feuds and break up families.
            An artist has settled in the village. His art pieces are terrible beyond all comprehension and cause people to get sick and physical pain. After just a few days, some of them animate and turn into hideous monsters. Nobody knows where exactly the artist is hiding.
            A storyteller has arrived in town. He’s extremely charming, even too much: people stop working to listen to his tales, and some become unable to distinguish fiction from reality. Others lock themselves in their rooms, daydreaming, only coming out when a new tale is being told.
            There is a well in the keep, and sometimes coins fly out of it, followed by a voice making a wish. If the wish isn’t fulfilled, more coins arrive, but the voice is angry. Then pebbles start to fly out followed by cursing, eventually it’s rocks, knives and axes, then deadly spells.
            A metallic globe has appeared over the keep. It floats roughly a hundred meters in the air, immobile. Sometimes, it exudes blood that then rains over the keep.
            A couple of tailors arrive in town, they sell an incredibly rare material: an invisible cloth that only smart people can see. It is true, and people with Intelligence over 16 see it. It is very beautiful and comfortable and resilient.
            A woman arrives in town. She appears to be a regular peasant, but she’s very charismatic and starts rallying people to go to a holy war. She is very convinced of herself, and many are ready to follow. If they do, the town will lose a lot of its population and be unable to function, but she’s on a mission for God.
            A group of people that looks identical to the players arrives in town, pretending to be let into their keep. Who are these fools impersonating them, they ask? What trick is this? They demand the players get kicked out. The issue is, these fakes are all smarter and more likeable than the real ones, so many peasants are on their side.
            A servant rushes to the players, covered in sweat. A woman is dying. She overdosed on some weird drugs that a gnome sold them that they were doing together. They’re secretly in a relationship, but she’s the daughter of a nearby nobleman. If she dies or their relationship is revealed, it will be a mess. Her father could very well start a war. He fucked up dude, but they gotta help him, or they’ll all be in troubles.

    moral dillemas
        You finally have the villain at your mercy, but their child is with them. Are you willing to kill an innocent child's parent in front of their very eyes?
        The village is going to be culled to prevent the spread of a terrible plague. Do you spare the villagers by preventing the cull at risk of millions of lives dying to plague?
        The villain has framed you for a crime you didn't commit, but to resist arrest would make it more likely that your reputation as an outlaw sticks with you permanantly. Do you turn yourself in?
        The wizard sent you on a simple errand: decomission his malfunctioning golem, but when you find the golem it is exhibiting obvious signs of sentience, and self awareness. Does it deserve the freedom of other sentient beings?
        The villain shares a common goal/enemy with the party and suggests declaring a truce to deal with the situation. Do you work together with your sworn enemy?
        You captured some enemy soldiers for information and have them at your mercy. Do you let them go and risk them giving away your position or slaughter the unarmed troops? 
        Your party is guilty of a crime (aren’t they all at some point?) and the local law enforcement has arrested someone else for it. Do you turn yourself in and save the person, or do you let them try him so you can remain out of prison?

        A bottle of stolen mead has been found by the party after a merchant warns them to be on the lookout for it. However, the rare mead is unattended and probably worth a nice chunk of change. The party can either steal it, sell it, and tell the merchant what they did, lie about stealing it, return it to the merchant, or do nothing. If the party ends up stealing or returning the mead, a later quest will reveal it was honestly bought and that the merchant, now gone, is something of a scammer. 
        You come to a crossroads and suddenly from the north a girl comes running down saying 'please help....they are about to sacrifice my sister' And then a boy comes running up from the other direction 'please help...my village is under attack' Helping the girl stop the sacrifice summons a demon but the sister is saved and the other village is slaughtered. Saving the village means the sister is sacrificed and the girl stalks the party waiting for her moment to strike to get revenge

        The party were the only witnesses to a child stealing something from a stall, but the city punishes stealing with death. If the party doesn't describe (and thus likely condemn) the child to death, the blame will fall on the only other possible thieves: themselves. 
        A local lord and his knights have recently killed an adult dragon which had been terrorizing the surrounding lands for years. There's one last job: go to the dragons lair and exterminate it's clutch of eggs and the remaining wyrmlings. None can survive or the lairs effects on the region will never go away. 
        There's a deadly and neigh-unbreakable curse that jumps from parent to biological child when the parent dies. The current curse bearer is a powerful wizard who keeps it at bay with ritual sacrifice of humanoids, using their souls to empower his resistance. The wizard has many children and dozens of grandchildren, and if he's killed, they'll quickly die from the inherited curse, them lacking his ability to resist it. 
        A senile old wizard has been secluded in the mountains, summoning mass amounts of monsters to keep himself from being lonely. The monsters run away from him out of fear but savagely kill innocents. Does the party kill him to stop the killings or go to the trouble of trying to find help for him. 
        There's a prophecy that a young child, descendant of a great hero, will be the gateway for a great demon to come back into this world by bursting out of the kid's chest. An evil wizard can get the demon out without harming the child, but the demon will be under the wizard's control. Do the heroes wait to see if the prophecy is false (it's not), enlist the help of the wizard and have to deal with that problem later, or murder the great-great-great-great grandchild of the man who saved the entire kingdom?

        You are fighting your way to a dragon's lair through some surprisingly smart owl bears, shambling mounds, treants, and other typically dumb creatures. You learn that to destroy the dragon's (or other BBEG) power will be to rob all these creatures of their intelligence that they now prize so dearly. partially based on a post by

        The local village is holding a firbolg named Thorbyrn prisoner, saying he killed one of the local guardsmen. The firbolgs have always been peaceful and all evidence suggests he’s not the culprit. He’s to be executed in the morning and the party must decide if they will save him.

    Plot hooks
        Easy hooks, outside forces. Straight-forward events where something threatens your stronghold.

        1) A room in the lower floor collapses, revealing a small crypt. There are no records of it being built, and it looks extremely ancient. Just a day after, everybody in the stronghold starts getting sick, their skin turns grey and blood drips from their nose and mouth.

        2) A room in the lower floor catches fire, out of nowhere. The next day, it happens again. And again the day after. The only strange thing anybody noticed was a maid that heard kids laughing in an alleyway, right before the fire started.

        3) A room in the lower flood EXPLODES in a geyser, that sends foul, brown, swampy water everywhere. Something crawls in it and it attacks people.

        4) A drunk dragon crashes through a window.

        5) A knight completely dressed in black, on a black horse, rides up to the door, demanding a duel. If defeated, the next day, a white knight arrives, demanding a duel. The thing keeps repeating, no matter how many times they’re defeated or killed.

        6) A knight completely dressed in black, on a black horse, rides up to the door, demanding a duel. It’s actually an empty suit of armour being moved by invisible fairies, looking to mess with the players. They’ll use tricks and illusion to make their opponent look ridicolous in front of their followers.

        7) The stronghold starts sinking. Apparently it was built on top of a swamp.

        8) The Stronghold starts floating. Apparently it was built in an area where gravity is magically weak.

        9) Trees start growing around the stronghold at incredible speed. In just a day they start growing inside and breaking through walls and floors. Strange naked people have been sighted in the new forest.

        10) A second stronghold appears in front of the first. It’s a mirror of it, but it’s all wrong, a bit crooked, a bit different, pieces out of place here and there. Warped copies of the players roam its wrong halls.

        Alright, we had some easy ones, pure encounters, go in go out. Now let’s get more personal.

        Inside hooks: your own people are involved. Peasants and followers did something you have to deal with.

        11) Witch hunters arrive early in the morning and drag away one of your maids. She’s a witch, they say. Someone gave them a tip, they won’t say who, but someone in the stronghold. The locals itch for a good burning, in any case.

        12) Half a dozen witch hunters are found dead inside the castle. Seems like they wanted to arrest someone. Rumours go around rapidly, and everybody is nervous. Accusations are thrown around.

        13) An NPC friend with the players arrives in town with a big haul. He scammed some wealthy merchants to get it. They didn’t appreciate it and caught up before he could get away. He asks the players to hide him and his “technically not stolen” wares in their stronghold.

        Legally, he didn’t quite break the law, so…

        14) One of the servants is caught with a bunch of stolen stuff in their room. Dozens of items, most of them worthless. A prank? Kleptomania? How will the players punish the thief?

        15) Magical items start disappearing from the players' inventory when they’re in the stronghold, and they are found inside the room of one of the servants. A big haul. “I’m being framed!” says the servant.

        16) A servants is cursed by a witch and suffers a horrible mutation that can’t be easily removed. The local clerics want them burned, the peasant, horrified, want them exiled. Will the players help the poor guy instead?

        A lot of people will be really unhappy if the mutant stays around, but he did nothing wrong.

        17) A servant is cursed by a witch. Everybody knows the servant deserved it, they were an asshole, unpleasant and downright violent.

        But they’re still a servant of the players. To insult them is to insult the players. Letting this go without punishing the witch will surely damage their reputation, and make people question their loyalty:" What good is serving them if they won’t even protect me?"

        18) A servant is caught embezzling money from the stronghold treasury. They were being forced to do it, they say; blackmail!

        19) A group of servants is caught organizing orgies in the depths of the stronghold.

        20) Some random traveller was robbed and murdered just next to the stronghold. Probably a servant did it, many seem to know about it, but nobody wants to talk.

        What for? The victim was a nobody, and nobody will ever know. Surely you’re not proposing to punish a faithful servant just for that? Let it go.

        Business proposals

        Sometimes being a lord means doing deals. Dangerous dels. Big gains, big risks.

        21) A thief lord approaches the players, proposing a collaboration: They want to open a thieves guild hidden in/ next to the stronghold. The players will get special access to the black market, discounts, information and the guarantee they won’t be targets of the guild, in exchange for protection and discretion.

        22) A fervent cleric proposes to build a chapel in the stronghold, together with a bunch of monks.

        They’re clearly dedicated and will bring blessings and protection from the agents of evil. They’re also nuts and may start witch hunts and oppress the locals. Refusing will bring their hammer, and, they say, the anger of the gods.

        23) A strange alchemist proposes to build a lab in the stronghold. The alchemist is talented, no doubt, and they offer the players some really neat potions. They’re also a bit unstable, and their experiments often get riiiight on the verge of going out of control.

        No problem, the alchemist guarantees. All cool. Just don’t ask about the previous laboratory.

        24) A druid tells the players they must let a sacred groove grow next to the stronghold. If they refuse they are an enemy of nature, like all other nobles.

        25) A merchant proposes to build a menagerie. Accepting would bring the players money and useful companions, but the merchant handles the animals with awful and violent methods. Still, technically it’s not illegal, and if the players find out only after the menagerie has been built, it won’t be easy to remove it without paying a hefty fine and causing a scandal. Not legally, at least.

        26) A famous artist proposes to build a theatre in the area. They are a real handful: annoying, pretentious and overbearing, but aren’t all great artists? Their talent is clear, the populace loves them and nobles love to be seen by others at their spectacles.

        27) An unknown bard proposes to build a small theatre, something simple, to make the peasants happy and entertain the kids. All very humble. Too humble, other nobles will surely dislike something like this. What a preposterous idea.

        28) Someone proposes to legalize prostitution and open a brothel in town.

        29) A group of dwarves proposes to build a large foundry in the stronghold. They’ll produce and sell weapons to the entire kingdom.

        Just imagine how much money you’ll make, selling weapons. Mountains of gold. Gold. Gold. Ethics? Eh, whatever. Think of the gold.

        30) The peasants beg the players to stop with the building and fixing: they are tired, the season is hard, food is scarce.

        The players can refuse an important upgrade/addition to the stronghold to make the peasants happy, but damage their reputation with other nobles, or work their peasants to the bone and gain a reputation as brutal dictators.

        Spooky Scary Skeletons and other shivers in the night. Scary plot hooks.

        31) At night, the peasants are kept awake by the sound of hands scratching and clawing coming from inside the walls and under the floor.

        Some, terrified, started sleeping in the middle of the street.

        32) At night, a shadowy knight runs around the village, hidden by the fog. Nobody knows exactly what it is, but it causes damages and gives everybody a good scare.

        33) At night, a voice crying and begging from help can be heard from the well in the middle of the stronghold. Nobody recognizes the voice.

        34) At night, entire fields wither and die. The plants are found completely black and dead in the morning, but no traces. It hits a different farm every night.

        35) At night, one more moon than usual can be seen in the sky. But only from the stronghold.

        36) At night, a massive swarm of insects covers the sky and lands on the village. They enter in every house, eating everything that can be eaten. They eat crops and animals too.

        37) At night, people are brutally murdered in the middle of the village. A good, old fashioned murder mystery.

        38) At night, somebody dug up all the bodies from the local graveyard and made a pile with them in the middle of the village.

        39) In the evening, as the sun is setting, strange figures can be seen walking between the crops. Some farmers go towards them, to see who they are, and never come back.

        40) At dawn, some peasants wake up covered in blood.

        Drastic events that could radically change life at the stronghold.

        41) A necromancer arrives at the stronghold and offers to put her undeads to good use, helping the players. They can be a great workforce: never tired, never sleeping or eating. Would make life for the peasants a lot easier.

        42) A strange plant starts growing in the village. Eating it makes people hallucinate. The peasants love it, and they look happier and more relaxed. What will be, if any, the long term effects, nobody knows.

        43) A drow enclave asks to move into town, or under it, to be more precise. They say they abandoned the cult of Lolth, and want to live a better life.

        44) Horrors and monsters start crawling in the woods around the stronghold, their numbers growing every day.

        Will the players delve into the forest, trying to find the source, leaving their settlement undefended? Or will they wall themselves in and hope to endure the onslaught?

        45) A horde of goblinoid arrives and says they want peace. They want to move in and work, peacefully, together with the players. They have shown they are powerful and capable.

        An alliance would have a lot of benefits, but other nobles and local farmers would both be hard to convince.

        46) The king demands the players send a large number of their followers and peasants to help in the war effort. Most of them will never come back, but it’s their duty, as nobles, to do so.

        47) A strange idea is going around the locals: they think the players are about to declare their independence, break off from the kingdom.

        Sure, they wouldn’t have to pay any more taxes, there is potentially much to gain, but the backlash would be enormous. The players can squash these rumours, hopefully before they reach the ears of the king. Unless they want to consider the idea…

        48) There is a strong independence sentiment growing between the locals. They don’t want to follow the players anymore, and a few rebels seem really good at riling up the crowd.

        The players can squash the movement with violence, try to gain back their trust, or hey, maybe they will accept and leave.

        49) A connection to an elemental plane opens in the middle of the stronghold. The players can keep it, and make an alliance with whatever is on the other side.

        Their followers and peasants will become a mix of regular mortals, planar-touched mortals and extraplanar visitors. Or they can try to close it.

        50) A Hobgoblin legion wants to work for the players. They are well organized, trained and armed to the teeth.

        Retainers. Hooks involving your most important followers. This is 20 long because they should have more weight than an average NPC. Remember that they’re people, with their own lives and interests.

        51) A retainer killed a commoner over a stupid discussion. The retainer is shocked and feels terrible. They ask to be exiled, they’ve been feeling confused for a while… all this power is getting to their head.

        They want to just stop and live like a normal person, away from everything.

        The retainer will be lost permanently.

        52) A retainer killed a commoner over a stupid discussion. The retainer expects the players will take their side. After all, it was just one, dirty commoner. Or so the retainer says.

        That would surely sour relationships with the locals.

        53) A retainer gets in a fight with a visiting noble. If things escalate, it could become a formal duel to the death. That would be… really bad, for the players, whatever the result will be.

        54) A retainer gets in a discussion with a visiting noble. The Noble pulls out a knife and wounds the retainer, in front of everybody. Scandalous.

        55) A retainer is found in bed with a peasant. She’s pregnant, but the retailer doesn’t want anything to do with her. Her family is outraged but could settle for a hefty payment, to keep everything under wraps. Still, small town, rumours spread.

        56) A retainer is found in bed with a princess! If this becomes public knowledge, it will be an enormous scandal. And the princess is pregnant.

        57) A retainer is found in bed with a peasant. The retainer is in love and asks to be let go from their job so the two can get married and go live together.

        58) A retainer is a vampire! They’re trying to keep it secret, but the voices of people being assaulted in the night spread rapidly.

        59) A retainer was attacked by an intellect devourer. Their intellect was devoured, and they have been replaced. A simple scout? The harbinger of a Mind Flayer invasion? Will the PCs even realize it happened?

        60) A retainer meets a dryad in the woods around the stronghold, falls in love and asks to be let go, so they can go live together, frolicking in the woods or whatever. If the players refuse, the retainer runs away.

        61) A retainer believes the players are being cheap. They demand to be given better equipment and more magical items.

        62) A retainer bought a pegasus from a shady merchant, to use as a mount. The unicorn is wearing a magical bit that makes it follow any order.

        63) A group of retainers have been helping the local peasants with some monsters. Nothing serious, very easy job, but the retainers are taking a lot of money from the peasants, to do it.

        64) Fight between retainers. It’s something petty, but both retainers are getting riled up, and both expect the support of the players.

        65) A retainer becomes a warlock. They met an entity and made a pact, in their free time. The players realize that this new patron is considered more important than they are, by the newly minted warlock.

        66) A retainer was out in the woods, hunting. The retainer saw something move and shot. That something was an elf, and they’re dead now.

        The retainer arrives at the stronghold in the middle of the night, carrying the body, desperately asking to hide it before the other elves find out and come for the retainer head. It’s possible they already know.

        67) A rival noble starts buying the players retainers, offering them a lot of gold, more than the players can afford.

        68) A retainer is often drunk, even during adventures, and their performance is terrible.

        69) A retainer is spying on the players, selling information to some rival noble or criminal group. The player can catch them during the exchange at night, hidden in the garden.

        70) A retainer has committed a blasphemous act and was marked by a god. Locals are horrified and hide as soon as they see the retainer. Other retainers expects the players to do something about it.

        Political hooks, if you want to game those thrones. Not every player will like these.

        71) Taxes. A retainer proposes to raise them, the peasants ask to lower them. The retainer says the players can use them wisely, and in the end, the peasants would be richer than without taxes.

        The retainer could be embezzling part of those taxes.

        72) A peasant insulted one of the players. The law says that a peasant insulting a noble should be punished harshly, and nearby nobles will expect nothing less.

        If the players find it excessive and refuse, their reputation will surely be tarnished.

        73) A peasant stole from the players. They were hungry and desperate, but the law is clear: off with their head. A peasant stealing from a noble is unforgivable. Forgiving the crime would be downright scandalous.

        74) A retired professor has a proposal: open a school for the local peasants. Teach them the basics, at least reading and some math and history.

        Sounds nice, right? WRONG! Other nobles find the idea absurd, and will not tolerate something like that. It’s a mockery of everything their society is based on, an attack at their status. Even the king is getting involved.

        The players will get in real troubles if they go through with this idea.

        75) A group of [race discriminated against in your setting] arrives at the stronghold, dirty and hungry, begging for refuge. Everybody expects the players to simply kick them out.

        Not to mention, what will we do if more arrive?

        76) An important noble wants to visit the stronghold. He demands to be welcomed the way he deserves: massive celebrations, plenty of food, games, music.

        The celebration alone will keep the players busy for days, not to mention the time it will take to prepare it, and the enormous waste of resources, food, and the time it will take from the peasants that could have other things to do.

        Refusing, while tempting, would carry heavy repercussions and the anger of the noble.

        77) A marriage proposal for a player. A noble family wants to organize a marriage.

        78) A high-level bard arrives in town and starts mocking the players. Legally, there isn’t much they can do to stop them, but the bard often goes past simple humour, and seems to be actively harming their reputation.

        Maybe the bard secretly works for somebody?

        79) A group of mercenaries wants to move in, offering to help protect the land. They are talented, and they would surely make the nearby lands safer, and their price is fair. They’re also aggressive, loud and violent with the peasants.

        80) A druid wants to build a temple to an ancient, primaeval deity, that almost everybody has forgotten. It’s not an evil deity, but its cult is forbidden in the kingdom, for reasons nobody remembers.

        The temple would surely bring boons and blessings, but also the ire of the king.

        Superstition and tradition. Plot hooks that involve regular people and their wacky ideas about the world.

        81) A wounded unicorn arrives in front of the stronghold and collapses, still alive, but barely. The local peasants are ready to butcher it: everybody knows unicorns can heal people, give youth, and are also very valuable.

        The players can stop them, but it will surely get a lot of folks grumbling.

        82) A large humanoid (any unconventional race) has wandered near the stronghold. The locals attacked them, tied them up, and are ready to burn them in the public square, even if the humanoid didn’t hurt anybody.

        83) Centaurs have been spotted in the woods nearby. The locals are terrified, they’re putting up barricades and want to set the woods on fire. There are local tales that depict centaurs as demons.

        84) A wounded Humber Hulk wandered outside the Underdark and died in front of the Stronghold. The locals want to eat it. Technically, the law grants them the right to do so, and they are convinced it’s some magical creature that will give them a health boost.

        85) A wolf was spotted inside the stronghold at night. The locals are convinced it was a werewolf, paranoia is growing and people accuse each other.

        86) One of the players accidentally broke an old local law. The punishment would be having their hands cut. The locals take these things very seriously.

        87) The locals are convinced a nearby pond is magical and will protect the village during a famine if you dump carts full of food in it.

        Throwing away tons of food during a famine seems like a bad idea, but the locals are adamant it’s the only way, and it worked in the past.

        88) There is an inn in town, and occasionally, a traveller disappears. It’s the spirits, say the locals: they spirit people away, no big deal. Been happening for years. Don’t look into it, and don’t investigate the inn.

        89) Locals regularly bring offerings to the “guardian” of the village. A spirit that watches over them, they say. If the players check it out, they easily recognize it as a dangerous Chimera.

        90) There is an eclipse. The locals are ready to kill all the babies born this day.

        Put the players in the spotlight. Roleplay-heavy hooks that directly involve the characters.

        91) A peasant is in love with one of the players, and start courting them.

        92) A drunk peasant, angry over something trivial, throws a glass of wine in the face of a player, in front of everybody.

        93) Seeing the wealth of the players, the peasants accuse them of being thieves, of taking advantage of them and their land without sharing.

        94) A rumour that the players are Satanists is spreading around the stronghold. Apparently the high-level magic they use is making their followers nervous.

        95) A writer wants to write a book about one of the players, a glorious ballad of their deeds. They ask to be allowed to follow them, in their adventures and also during their daily life.

        96) Worriesome rumours about a player reached the ears of the inquisition. They demand an investigation: one of them will follow the player, in their adventure and also during their daily life, judging their actions. No secret shall be kept from the inquisitor.

        97) A local woman is pregnant, one of the players is accused of being the father.

        98) A kid arrives at the stronghold, dirty and covered in rags. All they have is a letter that says one of the players is their parent and must take care of the kid.

        99) A rival of the players, encountered in a previous adventure, attacks the village and takes some peasants and some followers hostage.

        100) The players go back to their stronghold after an adventure and find out they are already there: there are identical copies of their characters running the stronghold.

        All the peasants and followers thought they were the real ones. Both groups accuse the others of being imposters.

            11	is colour dimming and darkness deepening.

        When this apocalypse occurs,

            2	the stars will rain down, burning away the forests and the seas.
            3	the barrier between worlds will wear thin and tear, merging a corner of the multiverse into a mind-bending mosaic.
            4	light will fade from the heavens and all the world will become the larder of monsters swarming up from its shadow.

            8	complexity will flatten until only an infinite featureless plane exists. Higher thought will be one of the first things to go.
            9	things will begin to decay while still living, the only way to stave it off for a time being to devour another living thing.
            10	the world will be swallowed by a tempest. The land will be drowned by sky-high waves and vapourized beneath volleys of lightning.
            11	all water will become bitter and undrinkable, the soil will lose its goodness, and the glare of the sun will intensify until everywhere is a bleached desert.
            12	all people will become utterly atomized and alienated from each other, irrevocably separated into personal realities that can only contact each other through horrific violence.
            13	a veil will be lifted, and everything up until that point will seem to have been very silly. People will laugh themselves to death, or not bother with anything further until it all falls apart.
            14	every pantheon’s Götterdämmerung will kick off at once.
            15	the perfect cancer will metastasize, an immortal disease that assimilates all life within it.

            19	sorcerous ability will appear at random in people, in frequency and potency never before seen. Their magically-backed whims will tear reality asunder.
            20	the tools and machines of humanity will sprout new forms and complexities at an accelerating rate, coating first the planet and then the sun, ushering in the obsolescence of mere meat.
        In the aftermath of this apocalypse
            1	the continuity of time itself will break and turn upon itself.
            2	all will decline, crumbling over eons into the void.
            3	the few survivors will shed their lowly flesh and ascend.
            4	the world will return to primal innocence, as it was in the beginning.
            5	the lands of the living and the lands of the dead will switch their places, and ghostly throngs will feel their pulse quicken once again.
            6	the cosmos will reset to the day before it kicked off, with everyone retaining fractured memories of it.
            7	hyperdimensional vulture-analogues will pick over the wreckage.
            8	the planet will explode and fill the cosmos with its shards of new kinds of being.
            9	the dregs of the world left over will drain down to become a new layer of the Abyss.
            10	there will only be goblins left.
            11	a circle of skalds will attempt to save some part of the world by singing its stories into other realities.
            12	the world will be quarantined by the proper authorities to prevent its spread.
            13	the world’s countless ghosts and sundered futures will merge and be extruded into other worlds as destrudinous psychic sludge.
            14	most of the world will be reborn through random fluctuations in thermodynamic equilibrium many eons hence.
            15	the luckiest survivors will sail on celestial winds into the new world born from the old’s ashes.
            16	the dead world will be raised as a necrokosmos by an arch-necromancer in another universe.
            17	a new ecosystem with new peoples will emerge, adapted to the changed reality.
            18	the most interesting survivors will be put in an ultraterrestrial zoo.
            19	the world and its ending will repeat, diminished and degraded each time, as though remembered by a senile god.
            20	explorers will come from unreached elsewhere and marvel at what once was.

Setting builder
    nice book?
        who authored it?
            precursors or the inhabitants of a previous reality.
            the work of a deity, saint or otherwise somehow divine in origin.
            a powerful mage or other form of spell caster.
            an aberration such as a(n)...illithid, aboleth, neogi, beholder.
            an outsider such as a(n)...celestial, fiend, elemental/genie, fae, or someone possessed by one.
            the culmination of the efforts of generations of scholars.
            author was taken by a eerie mood and wrote the work in a fortnight.
            it merely appeared one day, fully formed.
        
        what form does it take?
            tablets made of...stone/clay, metal, wax, wood.
            tome bound in...leather, metal, ivory, loose sheaves.
            scroll crafted of...paper, hides, leaves, cloth.
            graffiti, scrawling or runes etched onto a...structure, natural feature, path or road, cave.
            tangles of intricate ropes and beads in a language that may not still be known. may be read in the dark.
            a puzzle box or similar device. the secrets within are whispered into the mind of those who solve it.
            scrimshawed upon the bones of a(n)...humanoid, outsider, aberration, monster. may be read in the dark.
            woven into the fabric of a(n)...article of clothing, tapestry, blanket/quilt, tent/yurt
        
        what kind of lore is inside?
            the true names of...celestials, fiends, genies, fae.
            exhaustively indexed knowledge on an extremely niche topic such as elven architecture or goblin poetry. worth a small amount to most, but a huge sum to the right collector.
            a creeping form of madness which provides insight into the world. in exchange for losing one's mind permanently, the bearer of the work may ask it questions and gain answers 1d6 times per day as if they were using the spells find the path, augury, identify or clairaudience.
            a compendium covering the habits and weaknesses of...outsiders, aberrations, magical creatures, undead.
            the true and secret history of a...major empire, noble family, trade league, faith/cult.
            prophecies relating to the...end of the world, death of a deity, fall or destruction of a major empire, death of a famous figure, such as a warlord or archmage.
            insight into a complicated and fraught magical process such as...summoning outsiders, alchemy, reviving the dead, creating constructs such as golems.
            detailed accounting ledgers of a...trade league, noble family, guild, town/city council.
        
        is it trapped or have guardians?
            animates a mouth upon its surface and bites those who try to read it without the proper password. 1d6+3 bludgeoning damage. bites again every 2d10 rounds.
            lets out a blood-curdling scream and flies away at 60' turn if read anywhere except...under the stars, within a chamber with no natural light, upon unworked earth, a place of spiritual significance.
            locked. if an attempt is made to force it open it begins to weep gallons upon gallons of...blood, ink, water, ichor.
            the work is a keystone or plug of sorts, if removed or reproduced then...the area containing the work shakes itself to bits in 1d6 minutes, undead begin to appear around where the work is held, animals of all stripes become hostile to whomever bears it, bad luck follows the bearer, the referee may impose disadvantage on 1d2 rolls per day at their discretion.
            a cult or religious order is dedicated to safeguarding the work in some way. if it is stolen of copied without consent then they will surely seek to rectify the situation.
            magically bound to defend the work in some way until their destruction, the guardian takes the form of a(n)...powerful undead creature, outsider, monster, construct.
            only certain type of folk are able to read the work, it is gibberish to everyone but...non-spellcasters, followers of an obscure faith, the mad, someone who has never taken a life.
            the work itself is famous. while there is no one specifically looking for it, the very news of it changing hands may attract unwanted attention to those who now have it.

        "The universe is going to forget you! Have a nice day!"

        A large list of local/common names is listed on a wall. The words "The Promise" are written above it.

        A wall hosts 7-10 or so names, crudely carved upon its surface. The names of several local town officials are listed, including the current mayor, or other form of leader. The mayor's name appears particularly jagged in style. In the centre of the names, in large letters, the phrase "The Trash Rats" is carved, with a simple image of a rat carved crudely inside of the "a" of "Trash".

        The following phrase is written on the wall in chalk: "All Guards Are Villainous"

        Carved into the stone, the following phrase:
        "Let the owlbears consume me…"
        There is an image of a frowning face next to this.

        The following phrase in several different unique styles, and in different materials, crudely written into many different walls scattered throughout the city/town: "Sneak Goat"
        When questioned by the party about the phrase, locals will either burst out laughing or loudly exclaim "Skeak Goat!".

        The following phrase is inscribed into the wall:
        "While you live, shine
        have no grief at all
        life exists only for a short while

        Below this, in several different carving/handwriting styles, the names of several settlements, both local and exotic, are inscribed in a list.

        The following words: "We two dear men, friends forever, were here. If you want to know our names, they are James and Frederick."

        The following words:
        "you guys wanna hear something interesting? A man writes on a wall "no one will remember you once you're dead", but 3000 years later it is discovered and his note is self-refuting."

        Tally marks, counting up until the number 56, are shown. The final tally mark is circled. The word "Finally!" is inscribed next to it.

        Next to a dead end in an alleyway, the following is inscribed:
        "fuck the engineer that planned this shit town"

        The following is inscribed, in a back-end alleyway:
        "May everything turn out alright, so that you might leave this place."

        A crude image of an Owlbear is carved into the wall. It seems that, at a later date, wings were drawn upon the owlbear's back.

        An image of a phallus. Or several.

        The following phrase:
        "O walls, you have held up so much tedious graffiti that I am amazed that you have not already collapsed in ruin."
        Around this inscription, in several different writing styles, the words "Yes", "Agreed", or otherwise are repeated multiple times.

        The following words are inscribed upon a wall:
        "The light which brought peace to the darkness which surrounded me, the one who brought tranquility to the life of someone so small, has passed on, to the greatest unknown. Oh, Claire, there may be no statues in your name, no grand monuments to your beauty, but there shall be these words, scrawled upon such a place. And I hope this to be enough."*

        The following words:
        "We spent several days in the custody of Goblins. We celebrate our miraculous escape now, and appreciate the shortness of life." Below it, the following words in a different style:

        Below this, in an entirely different style, the words "Hidden Treasure of Snowfall replies here. I'm not sure whether to be flattered or offended."

        On a well-travelled road, there is a commonly used campsite, with a large rock in the middle. There are dozens of pieces of graffiti inscribed upon it, some wishing luck to travellers, some of various gods of travel, some warning of the many dangers of the area, including common strategies used to avoid them. Some are simple names, indicating travelers who have come and gone before.

        On a wall, the following is inscribed:
        "SCORCH (TOWN NAME)." Such messages appear common throughout the town.

        "We, the Alley-cat 5, do solemnly swear that one day we will make it out of this damn town."
        Below this, there is the following quote, signed by one of the apparent members:
        "I made it, guys. I made it. Signed - (NAME)"

        The following is inscribed:
        "Go to the house of Aeneri, for a good time."

        The following words are written on the wall outside of a small fast food-style place:
        "I remark that the owner of this establishment is a scammer, and a fraud! He charges 3 copper for a watered-down beer, and his sausages were served cold!"

        The following inscription:
        "My sets of expensive copper cookery were stolen, and have not been returned to me. A reward of 10 gold will be provided to any man who catches the thief and returns my property. Speak to Tallus at the (INN/TAVERN/RESTAURANT NAME) to learn more."

        The following inscription:
        "Am I even, like, here? Sometimes, I feel numb, like everything around me doesn't even exist. What am I doing with my life? What's the point of all this?! Is this all that I'll be, for the rest of my short life?"
        Inscribed below it, there are the following words:
        "Same, man. Same."

        An otyugh made a mess in the loo again.
        At the darts board, a wood elf is being hustled, and already owes a significant amount of money to the loud group of humans around him.
        The tavern is full of groups of tourists, all admiring a single poster on the bulletin board. Soon you realize they're all adventuring parties, and there is only one job left. They all begin to run out the door to be the first to complete it.
        A large cow sits in one end, with a wizard muttering "I'm sure this never happens babe" in its ear.

Nightmares
    You find yourself stranded in a desert, only sand from horizon to horizon. You keep walking but the dunes don't seem to come any closer. You feel extremely thirsty and slowly but steadily, your energy starts to fade. Hours seem to pass and when youre getting desperate, the sand in front of you starts to shift, a giant scorpion emerges and starts chasing you. 
    You stand before all those who have been affected by your rampant killings throughout your adventure. A wife who committed suicide after you killed her husband, a bandit. A son, clinging to his mother and asking when his father will be home. A woman, weeping for the loss of her daughter. A man brought to tears by the loss of his husband. They weep and ask why you've brought them such pain. You cannot see yourself and it is unclear whether they are actually referring to you or to the cursed item which is giving the dream. 
    You're having a normal dream and everything is 100% fine, then all of a sudden, certain items start to grow, then shrink, then grow, then shrink. You have no control of what it is or if it grows or shrinks and your forced to be 100% concentrated on this object. You're completely aware you're dreaming but can't stop. Whilst this is happening, a loud, deep bass drum is going off every couple seconds, it almost sounds like a war drum. You can hear it but you can't comprehend what is going on or where it's coming from. 
    You dream about $the next encounter$. 
    You are fighting a shadow rival, and the nightmare is different dependent on where you are sleeping: In the mountains, your rival attacks with a sword of ice and rock; In the forest, your rival strikes from shadows and bushes all around; In the desert, your rival attacks with a scorpion's tail; In a town, every passing villager is your rival; By the sea, your rival pins you underwater, gasping for air; Just before you awaken soaked in sweat, your shadow rival's face lightens to reveal your own reflection. 
    You're in a dimly lit room, you see a butterfly or moth struggling to fly and flapping against the wall. Walking over to investigate, you reach out to gently touch the grey creature, only for it to fall into dust as soon as you touch it. 
    You dream that you are chased by countless slow walking zombies and you can't defend yourself even if you want to. Also the floor is very slippery, like you are on a frozen lake, no matter how hard you try, you can't run properly. 
    You dream that the letter you were searching for a long time is in your hands now, but you can't read it, but everybody expects you to read it. You want to take your time but it gets worse and the letter begins to burn in your hands. You have a little time to read this important information, good luck trying. 
    You dream that you are a constant state of falling. Everytime you think that you are going to hit the floor, a gigantic monster appears and swallows you to another dimension and you keep falling in there too. 
    You find yourself in a battle for whatever cause you champion, whether it be the safety of a loved one or the annihilation of your most despised enemies. The battle is a crucial one, one you’ve prepared for for months; however, every strike you make falls short, your body feels sluggish whenever you move to attack - as if you’re wearing full plate underwater or you’re one of those squishy wizard-folk - all your spells fizzle and drown as you find yourself unable to speak. You watch helplessly as you fail to protect your loved ones from horrible fates, your empire crumbles around you, and your every last pleasant dream lies in shambles at your feet. 
    You dream that you've lost all of the skill and experience you've gained over your travels. If you were a melee user, you feel your muscles wither away and your attacks are as weak as a child, a magic user, your spells backfire or are weak and useless, an archer would watch his arrows fly wildly off-target, etc. You can get creative with the description here, if a PC is proud of a certain skill you could describe in brutal detail how awful they've become. 
    You dream that your body is overtaken by a malicious presence, and you watch as a helpless captor while it slays your companions using your body 
    You dream that you've died, and your companions forget about you completely. Meanwhile, you linger on as a spirit and watch your party go on without you and meet great success, seemingly much better without you dragging them down. 
    In your dream you suffer a grave wound, and instead of saving you, your party decides to put you out of your misery, you spring awake just as you feel the cold steel of the blade meet your neck. 
    You go out for a night on the town with your friends. All is well and you are having a great time. Eventually the inevitable time comes when you must rest. Finally alone, the faint music and noise of the tavern behind you, you feel relaxed and at ease. Strangely relaxed, even as a hand morphs out of the wall in front of you. It gives a slow wave, so you feel like it is friendly and even wave back. Strange, when did it get a friend? Why do they keep trying to touch you? You decide to leave and try to turn away but there are more hands beside you now and they grab you. No matter how hard you try, you cannot break free, more and more of them grab at you, pulling you towards the wall. You manage to get out loudly as they somehow pull you into it, but you are cut off as a hand covers your mouth and pulls you through the wall. You see your friends rush into the room and bite the hand and try to shout to them, but they cannot hear or see you from this side of the wall. You watch them search for you fruitlessly until you are pulled screaming further into darkness. 
    You dream that you wake up normally, however as soon as you speak for the first time, you are interrupted mid sentence by biting your own tongue. You try to curse the pain away only to spit blood and teeth from your mouth. Frantically you scramble to grab them with one hand while trying to stop the flow of blood from your mouth with the other. You can feel more of your teeth falling from your gums into the sea of blood filling your mouth. Strangely, the person you were talking to does not seem shocked by this and continues on normally. You try to shout to them for help, hell, for anything, even a bowl to catch the pieces of you falling off, but only succeed in spraying them with a mouthful of blood and your remaining teeth. They still seem unphased, even as you raise your hands to your mouth in surprise to feel it, only to have your lower jaw slough off. Panicking you reach for them, only to find that your limbs crumple at the joints as you try to move them. Your entire body slowly crumpled as bits break or fall off until you are nothing more than a blob of mangled human parts in disarray, staring up at your friend as breathing becomes harder and harder to do. You wake up just after you black out. 
    You are awakened by strange noises outside. Some sort of loud commotion. You decide to get ready and investigate. As you head out, you are stopped by someone close to you. They start trying to tell you something. By the way their hands move, it must be important, but only an inhuman screeching comes out of their mouth when they talk. Their lips don't even move. You try to get them to repeat themselves and they seem to get frustrated and grab a notepad. You feel a slight relief for a moment before they turn the pad to you so you can see what they have wrote and it is just jagged scribbles. Others try to help them explain what's going on to you and progressively everyone gets more and more frustrated but you still can't understand them. You wake up screaming as one of your party members jumps on in a rage after an extended effort trying to get the point across to you. 
    You find yourself seemingly restrained, looking down you see your a baby swaddled in a course blanket. An unseen figure picks you up and begins to carry you, walking at a slow hobbled giant. Eventually you are laid down on a forest floor and the unseen figure walks away. A rat scampers over to you and climbs on your chest, you feel yourself smiling at it, soon there are more, 3, 6, a dozen, two dozen! They climb over biting into your flesh until you succumb to death from a 1000 bites. 
    You’re racing away from a darkness that threatens to swallow you. Something about this darkness and it’s inky blackness seems to be erasing everything it touches and the daylight begins to dwindle. You claw a slide down the edge of a wet leafy steep and slip into the pond far below. You expect cool water to wash over you but it’s oddly warm. You breech the surface and are horrified to discover you’re swimming in a pool of vomit. It’s in your mouth and nose, choking you as you start to drown, gagging over and over. Finally you realize that you are laying down, and the gagging is real, that you are actually beginning to choke on your own vomit. The character continues gagging afterwards for 15 minutes. 
    You're walking along a path when a heavy silence falls, like a great weight is placed on you. You look up to a forest in flames as large monstrous heads on necks higher than trees glare down upon you. 
    You slowly wipe the tears from your eyes before opening them. All around you the crowd shouts. 'You are a terrible person.' 'You should never have existed.' 'Scum of the earth.' Wiping more tears from your eyes you slowly turn your head upwards. Before you, silhouetted by the gray cloudy sky, stands a tree with a rope hanging from it. A hooded figure places a platform beneath it. A person is pushed towards it. You wish you could forget them but you can't. It's your partner of over 300 of your most beautiful, wonderful, joyful moons. The crowd's shouting gets louder. 'Murderer.' 'Terrorist.' 'Villain.' You continue to watch, knowing they are innocent with all of your heart, mind, and soul. The shouting gets louder. Your world is consumed, leaving only the shouting, the rope, and the love of your life. The shouting reaches its peak as the rope is tied around their neck. You can't take it any more. Rushing forward towards the tree, crying out in agony all the way. You push aside a guard and feel cold, hard steel piece through your back. A lung ruptures, but before you die you hear one last thing, 'You could have lived. It only had to be me.' Darkness fills your vision as the rope goes taut. 
    The weight of a cask of ale presses down upon your back as you return to your home village from the city. Birds sing as they fly through the sky's bright, cloudless blue. You set down the cask for a rest and begin to play a joyful tune on your ukulele. Gray clouds begin rise over the horizon but they don't look quite normal. After some thought you realize that it is smoke coming up from the only place you've ever known. The birds go silent as you leave the cask behind and start running. The cries of your people blend with screams of the invaders before echoing across the landscape. Praying to all of the gods, you continue only to run face to face with a strange person clad in dark armor and wielding a shining sword. Past them you can see your parents on the ground crying over the body of your sibling. Your childhood friend sees you and shouts to run while you can. The attacker grabs you and kicks you to the ground. Another one approaches and begins to mock you. You wish you could do something to stop this. You would willing surrender your life to end the suffering of your people. But that chance never comes, a sword pierces through your heart and you fall to the ground. The last sounds you hear are the cries of your parents and the angry shouts of your friend. Your vision fills with red before fading to black. 
    The bustling crowds push past you as you walk to your favorite bar. Once you arrive at your normal seat an unfamiliar dwarf comes up to you and sits down. 'I have an opportunity for you.' Intrigued you start paying very close attention. The dwarf pulls out a rune covered deck of cards, 'How many do you want.' After some questioning they explain that the cards are items of great power. You agree to take third cards and pull out the first one. On the first card a bright, golden, almost glowing orb appears. Years of experience flood through your mind while a belt wraps itself around you causing strength to surge through your body. Extremely satisfied with the outcome you pull out one more. On this card a the image of a golden key glows before a powerful magic $Important Item$ appears in your grasp. You can sense the sword or whatever] would strip away the soul of anyone unfortunate enough to get hit by you. The third card has a cloaked figure on it and no apparent effect occurs. You try to thank the dwarf but find they have already left. After celebrating by getting thoroughly drunk you return to your home and pass out almost as soon as you enter. You awake to find your spouse standing over you and bring down your new sword or bring down a sword whilst wearing your new whatever] on your throat. The air escapes your lungs and you hear nothing from them before your vision fades to dark. 
    A small sidewalk cafe in the open market. The character is seated and finds the body feels so heavy As to be unable to rise. Waiters and then passersby stop one after the other in front of the player placing plates full of offal in front of them. Disgust colors their faces as they take the plate away empty. The character doesn't remember eating but feels fuller and fuller. The crowds begin cutting of their own body parts to set before the player only to react in fear and loathing as empty plates are taken away. If the player ever tries to actually eat what is front of them they look down and see their own half eaten body and blood on their hands. 
    Climbing up the circular interior stairway of a tower castle the sense of something BAD following increases. The faster the character tries to get away the tighter and tighter the hall becomes until the press is suffocating. If the player turns around they find the stairs crumbling behind them into a void where they would fall forever. 
    A giant approaches and you reach for you weapon only to find an empty sheath. The creature laugh as it points out you forgot your pants as well. The rest of the party starts to chuckle also until one then the other notices that (whomever of the party the character likes most) has been slain with the lost weapon. 
    You are a Shepard, tending to your flock of sheep. You feel relaxed as you count them jumping over a fence, one by one. But pretty soon the sheep coming over the fence becomes a flood as they swarm around you. Soon you are completely surround, tormented by their inhuman moans as they stare at you with their alien eyes. 
    you dream that you are drowning in ghostly hands that pull you into the ground while the item floats before you 
    you dream a friend gives you a gift in a box and when you open it, the item lies inside and when you look back at your friend they are swiftly withering into a corpse 
    you dream of walking through a large empty house at night and tormented voices call to you behind closed doors but never anyone behind them 
    you dream you're standing at the banks of an icy lake at night and you can hear the item call your name over and over, knowing it lies at the bottom of the lake while silent figures around from the bank point at you, their eyes milky white 
    you dream that you visit a royal figurehead but when you are left alone with them, they begin to choke on blood in their mouth and the guards enter, convinced that you are the murderer 
    You're in an outhouse, when something big starts slamming on the door, trying to break it down. The slamming slowly gets louder, and you try to get up to escape, but you find yourself chained to the seat. The banging suddenly stops. The door creaks open and you hear a rasping breath, a cold chill engulfs you. You hear the breath get louder and louder, until it feels like it's almost in your ear. Then suddenly, the thing screams in your ear and you wake up in a cold sweat, screaming. 
    A little child stands before you. They reach out a hand towards you as if for help. An ax appears nested in their skull. A spear appears through their heart. They screams as blade after blade impale them; crying out for you to end it; end their misery. A small obsidian glass dagger appears in your hand. But you can’t do it. You wake up with a start, sweating, with the dagger clutched in your fist. 
    You are writing a letter or playing an instrument at a feverish pace, but your fingers start to quickly grow weak and you lose sensation in them. The skin and muscles on your fingers slowly starts to rot off the bone, but you cant stop moving them until the bare bone that remains falls off and you are left with only a bleeding stump for a hand. 
    You have a ship to catch. It leaves in just a few minutes and it is absolutely imperative you get on it. But for every few steps you take, the road shifts so that it goes at right angles to the path to the ship, and it lengthens. You keep going faster and faster, but cannot catch up. Periodically, you come upon people who ask you questions, and you have to give the right answer to move on, or something terrible will happen. 
    Your party is is the entrance to the $BBEG'S_LAIR$. Your comrade says 'On three. 1...2...' You glance down. You are naked, directly under the continual light globe in the ceiling, forgot to prepare any spells this morning and are not proficient in the bizarre exotic weapon in your hand. Your friends look at you expectantly to lead the charge. ... '3!!!!!' 
    You go about your day as usual, when you suddenly feel your teeth loosening as you touch them with your tongue. They start to fall out one by one, and you can't do anything against it.
    You find yourself sitting at a table in a dark room along with others, trapped in an hypnotic state and mumbling sentences while referring to yourself in third-person. 
    The dream is wonderful. All of your friends and family are there. Even the ones who have passed away. You feel elated and joyful. Everyone lives forever in the light. Then, slowly you realise that this can’t be real. People do die. Most of these people are dead. You will die too. 
    You are traveling a road by your self. The road begins to wrap around and suddenly you realize you're traveling in a circle you can't escape from. No where to go but forward you encounter someone traveling ahead of you on the same direction . As you catch up to him/her you they began to seem familiar. As you get close enough, you see it is yourself, only horribly disfigured. A gaping wound in your chest. And your face horribly scarred. This future version of you gasping for air says 'don't trust them' and falls over. 
    you are fighting with your closest friends against a horrible monster (beholder or something similar) when you are suddenly compelled to turn against those who have saved you countless times and whom you have grown to love and trust. you slowly kill them before killing yourself out of grief. 
    You are running from a horrifying monster the likes of which you've never seen before. He moves at a slower pace than you but he never seems to tire while you feel yourself fading quickly. Up ahead you see a house. Safety! Surely, if you get inside and lock the door you can buy time to find a hiding place. Your speed picks up, energy renewed at the thought of safety. Finally making it you slam open the door and dart inside. You survey your surroundings when suddenly you feel a hot breath on your neck. In that instant one terrible thought makes itself horribly clear. 'I forgot to lock the door.' 
    You dream you are staring into a mirror, your reflection smiles evilly at you before turning its back to you and walking away. The world surrounding you starts turning to glass and crystal, as your body turns to glass you awake. 
    A giant crystallized skull floats in space surrounded by stars, as the skull rotates to face you you catch a glimpse of light shining from inside the skull through one of its eye sockets. 
    You are sitting with your friends at a table in a tavern, having a meal when suddenly you find yourself bringing up a secret you hide from them. Then closest or more vulnerable friend]'s head rolls off. The severed head says 'no wonder you hid this, you monster.' You look down, your meal has turned to blood. You look back up. All your friends have lost their heads now, and they lay slumped over the table. 
    You are trapped in a giant butler's sink in dirty water and the plug has been removed and the water is beginning to swirl pulling you round and down sweeping you past giant utensils just too distant or too fast to catch. 
    You are nothing more than an imaginary puppet dancing to the tune of laughing godlike beings who decide your fate with a casual toss of dice. 
    Your party have forgotten you exist, and are trying to kill you or they torture you instead 
    You dream of getting stitches from a huge living orange with an artificer's crank-powered sewing machine... 
    You start by entering a room. There's a chest. It's a mimic. You run and open a door. It's a mimic. You bring out your sword. It's a mimic. The room is a mimic. Your chestplate is a mimic. Your helmet is a mimic. YOU are a mimic. 
    You’re wandering alone in a forest. It’s dark and cold, but there’s no snow, just a bitter frost that clings to everything. You can feel the numbness in your fingertips slowly spread up your hands and arms. You vaguely understand that you won’t last long - that you WILL die if you don’t find shelter from the cold. Up ahead you see a light. Maybe an inn? Just a small cottage? At this point anything will do. You try to walk towards it, but you can’t control your shivering and you collapse on the forest floor. You can’t move your fingers, but you can claw your way forward, inch by inch. Finally, you’re at the edge of the clearing, but you’ve used the last of your strength. The cold binds your screams in your throat, and your body shakes uncontrollably. Eventually even that ceases, and all you can do is watch the people through the windows as the frost covers your eyes. As you struggle to hang on to your last breath, knowing that once you breathe out no more air will enter your lungs, you wake and realize your chest hurts from holding your breath. 
    You sit next to a campfire. The party members surround you. You all tell stories, recite poems and jokes, and drink to your hearts content. Eerily, you hear a soft whisper in your ear, and you feel a sharp blade crawl across your neck. You watch in horror as your closest friends observe you bleeding to death and do nothing to help you. 
    In a bustling city you watch you party members getting slowly eaten by giant $Terrifying_Creature$. None of the citizens around you seem to hear you or do anything about it. 
    You find yourself laying down in a heap of snow in a frozen forest, barely alive, your friends are around you... (they are either all laying down, all standing, all dead, etc) 
    You find yourself at home, in the night outside your house. A terrifying attacker chases you inside, only to find your family/friends who are too busy to even take notice. You fall victim to the attacker as they sit idly by, ignoring your screams. 
    You find yourself among a crowded urban area, a market perhaps. However, you quickly realize everything, from folk to beast to nature itself, is running backwards in time. You try to interact with someone, to no avail. Suddenly you notice a hooded figure across the street staring at you. As you try to discern it's shape, you see a humanoid creature with an upside down face, screeching as it points in your direction 
    You and your companions are having a meal. Only thing is, there's no food, only charcoal on the plates. You turn it away, but everybody is staring at you seriously. You feel a hit on the back of your skull and dizzily watches without reacting your friends tying you to the chair and force-feeding you. It tastes like ash and you feel your throat bleeding as you swallow. 'You gotta eat, $Name$' 'Gotta keep your fire lit'. 
    You stand at the end of a large stone and wood bridge, the land around you dead and barren, the sky dark aglow with an eerie orange light. The wind howling as you scan around, you notice the bridge and the surrounding area as place from your childhood. Though then it was vibrant and lush with life thriving all around. As sadness and despair begin to settle into your gut you hear a ferocious wicked growl. From the shadows a large beast with razor sharp teeth, gnarled spines growing out of it's back, and blood thirty eyes starts moving towards. You try and runaway but move slowly as the horror approaches, half way across the bridge you stand consumed in shadow. The beast is upon you and ready to... 
    You are walking on the docks at night with your? child, you look to your left and a massive serpent made of black bones slowly rises from the dark water. You freeze but your? child keeps moving, playfully running forward. You wake up as the serpent lunges at your child?. 
    It's winter, you're a wolf running with your pack. They find something to eat in the snow and you join them. After a few bites you look down, you've been eating the half frozen remains of your loved one. 
    A $Charming_Friendly_Creature$ offers you blueberry cake. You eat the cake, and begin to expand and turn blue. Then your adventuring comrade yells 'Gonna Pop!' and everyone ducks for cover! 
    You wake up in your camp and hear the soft crunching of branches. As you look, you hear a growl behind you. As you turn to face it, a $Terrifying_Creature$ leaps at you. You feel warm breath on your face as it begins to take a bite! 
    You're hunting for an offender, and as you are about to shoot, they hide behind the last tavernkeep you saw. You shot them instead and the offender's shadow looms over you. Smothering you! 
    You're on a sandy beach and realize $Skittering_Creatures$ are crawling all over you. They engulf you completely. 
    You find yourself at a gathering of those you admire. Great heroes, beautiful lovers, and influential figures. They're all looking at you with admiration. You open your mouth to speak, but you feel your teeth begin to fall out. As each one clinks to the stone floor, you can feel the disgust roll over you, the taste of blood in your mouth making you sick as you wake up gagging. 
    You see (npc or character they're most attached to) approaching, as you go to embrace them you notice a look of surprise then pain cross their face, as you look down you see your hand, scarlet, as the blood drips down your elbow the drops in the pool of blood bring you back to awareness, they whisper one word 'Why?' as the tears run down their face mixing with the blood the last thing you hear is the dripping of the blood flowing down your arm. You awaken to the sound of the rains last drops collecting in a pool nearby. 
    You move to awaken $party_member$ for their turn on watch, but as you move you notice an odd weakness in your legs, as you look down you notice for the first time the flesh on your hands slowly melting and sloughing off revealing the pitted/ rotted bone beneath, as you go to scream out in horror/pain,your legs give out from beneath you, the impact knocking the breath from your lungs. As you lay there feeling your body slowly dissolve, unable to draw breath you see a pair of malevolent feline eyes staring at you from the lowest branch in the tree you were resting against, the cat begins to take shape and as it leaps at you it bursts apart as a swarm of spiders engulfing you, you awaken to your own screams, realizing it was just a dream, but a prickling along your spine and the echoes of a malicious laugh leave you wondering, was it really only a dream? 
    It's hot. Humid. You're holding an unfamiliar crossbow-like weapon. You lie motionless in a row of bushes along the edge of a flooded grain field. Dragonfly-shaped airships circle overhead with a powerful thumping sound, and begin to debark men clad in green. With a stuttering roar, some kind of automated wand sprays red magic missiles into the green-clad men from somewhere on your left. Their crossbow-like weapons glow with flickering star-shaped flame as they respond. You wake with a start, wondering what that even was. 
    You are being pursued by an immense fat demon made of glass. You can only run, because if you try to hide, it bursts through even the stoutest stone wall with a cry of 'OH YEAH!' Brilliant red ichor sloshes visibly within its skin at every step. 
    The party is ambushed by goblins. Just as you are about to enter the fray, you feel a breeze. One of your party members asks if you're forgetting something. You look down and see that you are nude. The party laughs. The goblins laugh. You wake up cold, the blanket having slid off the bed. 
    An airship envelops you in golden light and you float up from the ground. A group of hairless gray Deep Gnomes straps you to a table and performs a thorough examination. Uncomfortably thorough. They shine a glittering light in your eyes and you jerk awake. It's an hour before dawn and you can't recall making camp last night, even though the tents are set up. 
    You are standing above the sky, leaning against a wall of glass, looking down on the familiar coastline of your homeland, made strange by this new perspective. A menacing shape, clearly made of metal, slides soundlessly into view and begins to project beams of light at the points you know hold towns. 
    You're in complete agony. You move the hand away from your mouth to see it is covered in blood. The blood continues to drip on the sides of your mouth. You run to the nearby commoners walking among the streets begging for help except nothing you say makes sense. The words appear to be gurgled by the amount of blood. They look at you strangely and push you away as you bleed on their clothing. Looking into a mirror placed in front of a store, you use your hands to spread your mouth open and realize that your tongue has been extracted. The amount of blood begins to overtake you and you begin to choke. It is at that moment you wake up with a burning sensation in the back of your throat. You were choking on saliva in your sleep. 
    The bed you are sleeping in is really a mimic and is trying to eat you! 
    Your loved one is secretly a doppelganger and your real loved one is held captive far away. 
    Your favorite possession has been stolen and been replaced by a fake replica. 
    You're stuck in a white room with an eerie-looking statue. You don't know why, but something's telling you that you really need to leave or something horrible will happen. 
    You're stuck in some kind of time-loop, reliving the same day over and over again. Nobody will believe you, even as you predict every detail you've spent the last month or so seeing over and over. 
    A surreal rendition of $next_planned_encounter$. It takes a sharp deviation from the original when a shadowy creature picks the party off one by one and the dreamer is helpless to stop it. 
    You are stranded in a painted desert, and the sun is perpetually setting. The dry, dusty ground becomes a riverbed which flash floods and drags you under. 
    You are a bird, flying over someone dying. You alight next to them and they reach for you. 
    You are dying. A bird alights next to you. Then more. You are whisked up in a flock of small birds who peck and scratch. You know there will soon be no trace of you left, but you cannot.. or must not move. 
    A collection of live butterflies and winged insects sits in front of you, glittering like jewels. Your $Stern_Parental_Figure$ stands over your left shoulder instructing you in the method of euthanizing, and then mounting the insects for display and study. They tell you that you are not done despite all the bugs having been mounted. You realize they mean to have you mounted last, and expects you to do everything but the final pin. 
    Your teeth are loose. You pull one out by accident, but a second grows into it's place. You pull a second, and a third... 
    You see yourself in the mirror. You smile, and have too many teeth, and then your reflection drags you into the mirror and begins devouring you. 
    You go to show your friends some cool thing you can suddenly do, and find they are dead.. rotting hunks of flesh, but still moving. They bite and scratch, clawing at you, trying to drag you down. 
    You are lost and naked. Something is pursuing you, and the further you run the larger and more frightening it becomes, eventually looming on the horizon. 
    Wandering the labynthian corridors of a place you once knew well, seeking a murderer hiding amongst your friends. It starts to snow and inside the building there are snowdrifts everywhere. It is quite cold, and you are nearly naked. Your friends don't beleive you that there is a murderer and that it is snowing. You are also late, the murderer has killed one of your friends, and know that if you do not find the killer soon, then more of your friends will die. 
    A dream where you wandering through a cave populated with mannequins. All of whom are wearing the faces of your friends and family. At the back is a mannequin whose back is turned to you. You find yourself terrified at looking upon its face. But you don't know why... 
    You dream of your family members that are still alive are brutally murdered by someone or something. 
    Your beloved family pet turns on you, and you are forced in defense to choke it. It does not relent its attack as you do, and you're forced to continue choking until it dies. Its head swells and throbs with its heartbeat as you continue the hold, and it dies as the animal's scalp and face explode from the pressure of the blood you choked it with. Your pet falls dead from your hands, a brutal mess, and all the good memories you had with it flash before you and seem to crumble. 
    Your dream that you have severed ties with $best_friend$; yet contact continues, and they seem to be nearly everywhere in your life. They betrayed you, yet everywhere you go and everything you involve with they seems to be there. Frustrated, you approach them near a stream and berate them that it was they who wronged you and still goes where they know you will be. You begin to argue in earnest, screaming and furious, and as your vision blurs and tunnels, you find you have wrestled them to the bank of the stream, and to try to silence his screams, push his head in the water. Before you know it they are dead in your hands! 
    You are in a noble's salon, moving among salaciously dressed courtesans. Every drink you sip tastes like sand, and every caress fills you with horror. When you sit at the table they all set to, devouring the meat, but the sickly sweet smell of it makes you think of corrupted flesh, and the thought of eating it turns your guts. 
    You dream that you're in a dark room, and random body parts of all different races are appearing and disappearing sporadically. They begin striking you, chasing you, or assaulting you. Some have claws, others warts or a contagious disease...  
    You dream you're watching the stars when you feel a sense of losing your footing like you're going to fall into the night sky, nearly falling upward. As your feet leave the ground, the stars dim as a winged form stares at you, then you plummet into the cold ocean. 
    You dream that you're home reading by candlelight when you look up to see your $PET$ contorting; it's head and limbs sprouting second and third heads and limbs. Lightning flashes by the window and a dark monstrous shadow looms across the horizon line. 
    You dream you wake in your bed at home to the sound of the sound water flowing just out of ear shot. As you follow the sound you feel the wriggling of tentacles in your left hand and look down to see a writhing mess of small squid. 
    You dream that you are buried alive in the ground and waken to the cramped darkness, screaming & yelling as you scratch your nails bloody against the coffin lid. The ground outside is filled with burrowing and holes begin to smash open as black tentacles begin to writhe through slowly filling the coffin with their cold, slimy touches as they begin to suffocate you. 
    You dream of floating in a strange, airless void, with a scintillating blue field of stars on one side and a great black void on the other. As you look around, the void begins to grow, enveloping the rest of the sky, and as the last lights wink out you feel your body start to be ripped apart.
    "You dream of floating in a deep, dark ocean, with the only thing in sight a thin tapeworm like creature seemingly floating just below you. It's only as it rises up to devour you that you realize the worm is as wide as a world.", "You dream of awakening in a small cottage. You begin to fall upwards, suffering terrifying vertigo, as everything above you darkens and fades out of existence.", "You're sitting outdoors, with your loved ones around you. The sun is shining and you're having a picnic. Your favorite person says something that makes you laugh. Your laugh is interrupted when you cough. You look down at your hand, and one of your teeth has fallen out. You feel your other teeth grow and wiggle their way out of your gums and fall in your hand. You begin coughing uncontrollably, spraying the ground with teeth. The coughing turns to retching, and you start vomiting teeth. Not just human teeth, but dog teeth, shark teeth, teeth that fit in no sane mouth. They cut your mouth as they come up, and soon you are covered in blood and alien teeth... You continue vomiting teeth until you wake up.", "As the player sits in a semi lit up room, oddly shaped shadow appear from the completely dark corners and slowly creep towards them. When the shadows reach the player, they become physical entities. The shadow from the front-left becomes a two headed cyclops with two sets of insect-like arms with clawed appendages at the end. The one from the front right becomes slime-covered fat creature with a scaly tail lining down its back from the back of it neck and 4 eye stalks on its chubby head. It’s mouth is like that of a goblin shark. The one from the back left becomes a giant fly with two large horns on the sides of its head instead of eyes and a scorpion tail on its back. The one on the back right is a gibbering mouther with hundreds of legs on its underside. These four entities tear the player apart until they wake up.", "You put on your coat and get ready to leave your house. The hat stand is strangely empty. You feel empty; utterly empty. You walk to the $Place_Of_Employment$. Everyone you pass has a hat and is silently screaming.; You pass the silently screaming secretary in their neat fascinator. You reach your desk.There's your hat. A standard homburg. The desk where it sits is cracked and etched as if acid had been oozing from the hat. Your emptiness is being replaced by fear. Dread. Horror. You reach for the hat anyway...", "You awaken on a wooden slab when some cool, heavy liquid cascades onto you. It's hard to move or see, burning your eyes when you open them, but you can vaguely make out a gargantuan humanoid looming above you and skewers your chest and chops of your arm.", "Liquid begins to drown you. You attempt to scream, the salty sweet liquid fills your mouth and drowns out your calls. Strange creatures remove your limbs and then pick up your severed arm and toss it in their mouth, full feeling remaining as it masticates and swallows. As it drops in its stomach you are fully aware of the sensation of your arm's broken bones now being dissolved by the hot acid.", "You're running through a rain forest chasing some brightly colored bird. It's ducking and weaving through the lower canopy, just able to stay 20 feet ahead of you until suddenly it stops. As it turns its head the bird smiles a toothy, orcish grin that wraps around its entire head, motions at you with its beak and laughs like a hyena. Uncountably more sources of laughter flutter in behind and around you as the sky darkens with more and larger wings.", "Your $Parents$ are tucking you into your cradle, speaking in tongues with their eyes closed. When they lean in to kiss you their eyes open, and you see that under the lids are black holes, ringed with teeth.", "You wake up standing on a white pebbly beach before a great black ocean. As you stand with your feet in the surf you feel the tugging of the obsidian water at your legs, far higher than the surf should reach...Looking down, you see barnacles and suckers grabbing up to your knees, dragging you into the briny depths. Fighting kicking and screaming, you see an old man sitting on a big rock on the shore staring at you with gaping empty holes where his eyes once were. As your mouth fills with the inky black water and your vision starts to blur, the old man grins and begins singing an ancient sea shanty that, despite being pulled under the water, you can hear as if you were standing next to him.", "Everyone you ever knew or loved stands in a circle before you and behind you, and stabs you with a weapon, painfully.", "You and a band of soldiers face an army at a bank, trying to cross the lake. You pelt them with arrows, and they fire back. Suddenly it goes silent, and arrow flies out striking the man next to you. Attempting to bring him to your commander, soldiers stream from the bushes behind you, clubbing and slashing everything. You do not know whose who, desperately trying to protect anyone you recognize. One falls upon you, clubbing you with a rock as your arms go weak, unable to fight back.",

        The 'Golden Age of Magic' that took place hundreds of years ago actually never took place.

        A clan of changelings have secretly replaced significant individuals of power in order to steer the kingdom to its doom as revenge for somethinginfernal
        The kingdom is surrounded by tall walls that hide everything beyond. No one is allowed out because of the Great War between nations. In reality, there is no Great War.

        If you go into the Giant's Beard Inn, Soggy Frog Inn, or Quail's Tavern and ask about Rohir Borgenaut, they kick you out. That name means nothing to anyone else in the city. Why?

        I saw the court wizard flash a demonic handsign once, as he stood behind the Baron during an address to the people. Who was he trying to signal in the town? What does the signal mean?
        A farmer tells the party that his neighbor was NOT, in fact, killed by orcs three years ago. Orcs go house to house, killing and plundering. My neighbor was violently killed in his own home, and nothing was stolen! no other houses hit! I suspect it was the farmer's guild, they've been squeezing us really hard. I thought they were supposed to help us?!
        The humans in an elf-human city have invented a new device that the elves suspect was purposefully invented to hurt them: the printing press.

Spooky Tavern rumor
    1-2: 'Ey, did you hear about poor old Tom Gobbard, the fisherman? Apparently he was out fishin’ a fortnight ago, and he reeled in something that…wasn’t a fish. He’s over there in the corner, still gibbering uncontrollably, if ye’ want to ask him about it.

    3-4: I have it on good authority that a mysterious ship pulled into harbor just five days ago. Apparently, there’s not a living soul onboard. The captain and crew have simply vanished. The town watch investigated, and the entire ship was empty…except for a rather large box in the cargo hold. The ship is still sitting in the harbor. No one’s been brave enough to open the box.

    5-6: Did you hear that Captain Norkus died just last week? It’s true! Word is that he tripped on his own deck and snapped his neck. His family paid a LOT of money to have him resurrected, and they’re trying to keep it a secret. It’s just…ever since he was raised from the dead he’s been…different. It’s hard to put your finger on it, but he's definitely been givin' ME the creeps.

    7-8: Sit back, lad, I’ve got a story for you. Back in my youth, I sailed on a trader’s ship. We got blown off course, and made land on a green island, lush with vines and fruit trees. We thought we’d load up on fruit for the journey, but it wasn’t long before the island…started moving. We rushed back to the ship and I’ve never found the isle since.

    9-10: You want to speak of strange isles? Well, when I was a lad my crew and I found a rocky isle many miles north. It was a tiny isle, lonely and bare, save for a solitary, black tower. We considered exploring the tower, but thought better of it when the sun went down and the tower began to…sing. We loved our lives, so we boarded the ship and fled!

    11-12: The ghost ship is real, I’ve seen it! Head northwest of here, and, if the moon is full, you’ll see a glowing, purple pirate ship with ragged sails, floating just a mile’s distance away. No matter how close you sail, the ghost ship stays just out of reach…

    13-14: You want to hear something funny? There’s a tiny town on the east coast where everyone has the same name! I mean it, EVERYONE. The butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker, everyone in town goes by the name ‘Goxus.’ Come to think of it, they all speak with the same sort of…distracted tone of voice, too. Kind of odd, now that I think of it. Anyway, they’ve never cheated me so I suppose I’ll keep doin’ business with ‘em.

    15-16: Yes, this is Wicker the Parrot. I found him perched outside my window this morning. Can’t understand why his tail feathers have gone white, though…and where’s his master? This parrot used to talk nonstop, but now he only repeats one phrase… “Stay away from the Weeping Pool.” What do y’think that means?

    17-18: There’s a fishing village to the west where they don’t seem to like strangers, much. I was lost and needed an inn, so I convinced them to let me stay the evening. I wish I’d have just moved on. One evening, late at night, I awoke to the sound of soft chanting outside my window. I pulled back the curtain and saw everyone in town down by the shore, holding an infant high in the air. As I watched, three ugly, blue-skinned women climbed out of the sea and onto the land. I closed the curtain and went back to bed. Wouldn’t recommend staying there!

    19-20: If you’re sailing off to the west, keep an eye out. I’ve been hearing reports that there’s a big black storm brewing off the western coast. Strange thing, though, is that the storm has been building for several days, and the black clouds won’t blow away. Even stranger…some folks have been sayin’ that if you look at the black storm clouds just right, they look like faces…

Individuals
    Ancients
        The Swamp Lurker: a six foot tall elven woman with skin lesions and leprosy ulcers. The Swamp Lurker has been spotted in swamps all over the world and is always carrying a lantern. Legends say that she was once a cleric that was desperately trying to cure her city of a deadly disease. Those who make pacts with her have the strange quirk of attracting flies. She has been known to assist travelers as well as kill them.
        Corrin: an artificer that had achieved lichdom through human transmodifications. Corrin is now more machine than man.
        The Chained King: a large creature with black feathers and demon horns. The Chained King was punished by the gods for using forbidden magic. The Chained King now remains locked away by three chains, each will be broken if certain requirements are met. As of now one of the chains was broken when a woman gave birth to a beast.
        Fafnir: a 15 million year old red wyrm that has survived off of his unending list for gold. Fafnir uses his greed as motivation to remain forever living.
        Volk: a primordial living at the bottom of a volcano. Legends say when Volk arises from the volcano the entire continent will be lit aflame.
        Sobrick: a crocodile human hybrid often worshipped by lizardfolk who is said to spring from the bottom of the ocean depths to eat the sky when he escapes a maze of coral he is trapped in.
        Galia: The mother of all dryads, Galia is found in a forest in the feywild and is said to be 100-300 feet tall. Galia is responsible for creating seasonal change. If Galia dies she simply is reborn from her old corpse. Galia is lawful in nature and will only appear to those who she wishes to see.
        The Watcher: an invisible entity with eternal life grated to them by the gods of death. It’s impossible to know how old the watcher is or where they are at any moment but what is certain is they are always gathering information. Warlocks have made pacts with The Watcher but even they have never talked to or seen them.
        The Monolith: a monk that has been meditating for 2000 years. The Monoliths real name is Feng and he has not aged since he had been in meditation. The Monolith while being unconscious still has subconscious defenses. Many assassins have tried to kill The Monolith only to have their mind bombarded with psychic energy.
        William Greyhammer: a dwarven paladin that upon death was offered the opportunity to be the guardian of Celestia. William spends his days at the gates of Celesia making sure the people who enter are allowed there.
        Drakeslayer: a greatsword that was forged by a great cleric. Drakeslayer can speak telepathically and has a hatred for dragonkind. Drakeslayer is a +3 weapon and deals an additional 2d6 to all dragons.
        Behemoth: a 6 legged bear-like creature with chitinous plates and fur, a hairless head and sharp needle like teeth. Roaming the heart of the oldest forest in the land, its roar is audible from the villages near the edge. They say it sounds like the screams of thousands of creatures dying, and the war drums of a legion
        Goliath: a tiger-like creature with one pair of legs and a pair of muscular arms. It’s fur is thick and drips a dark viscous syrup. A head that looks almost reptilian in nature and thick sharp teeth like the heads of spears. It’s roar sounds like a screeching violin. On its stomach is a deep scar, scholars say the Goliath got this scar from a fight it survived with The Behemoth
        Spawn of Orcus: This entity is the result of an ancient summoning ritual gone wrong in the Underdark. 30ft in diameter, the Spawn of Orcus is an amalgamation of over a hundred humanoid corpses and skulls, fused together in a disgusting mutated formation of perpetually rotting flesh and bone. For centuries it has writhed in agony in a gigantic cavern known as the Sepulchre Sanguinis, where the original ritual once took place. Its agonizing wails can be heard for miles, and its only wish is it to spread pain and suffering to those who cross its path.
        Warforged Dragons: a peculiar species that was uncovered only recently. Warforged dragons are the rarest type of dragon and come in all forms of metals like copper, steel, iron, and even aluminum. The largest and most intelligent of the warforged dragons known is Gorashi. Gorashi breaths fire and poison, they have been known to make deals with mortals for knowledge they have gained in their lifetime.
        Barothgar: an orcish sorcerer that steals the remaining life force of the creature he kills. Barothgar has killed so many creatures that his estimated lifespan is 1.3 trillion years. Barothgar is a name feared by all orckin. Some old and sick orcs venture into his mountainous domain so that Barothgar can give them a warriors death.
        Phenrodna: A failed attempt at creating a being with the power of sorcery artificially, Phenrodna is sealed inside a large gemstone through the use of the Imprisonment spell, and has been for many hundreds of years. Originally a normal human, it has lost that humanity, the wild magic coursing through its veins mutating it into a mercurial form that is ever shifting, while also driving it insane, and making it exceptionally powerful. It can be released from imprisonment by three kings simultaneously touching the crystal.
        Karthonon: a lich that lives in the feywild and is worshiped by the fairies living near him. Karthonon uses his worshippers as subjects for his alchemichal experiments. Karthonon is as of now not very well known however many of the feywilds best divination wizards forsee of a dark being using his power to destroy the summer court. Whether the being succeeds is uncertain. The dark being these wizards see is Karthonon.
        The Weeping King: A ghostly apparition that resides in a lonely, decaying long hall in the wetlands. Tears seem to eternally flood from his eyes and his hellish wail drives men to their knees. When he holds aloft his chipped, rusted sword a host of long dead warriors manifest around him
        Kumbaka: a dragonborn bard that was one of the first dragonborn ever born into existence. Kumbaka spent his life learning as many instruments and languages as possible. One day using his charm and cunning Kumbaka made a bet to a god of magic that if they couldn't kill him before he was done with his preformance tomorrow was over then he would be unable to age and won't die until they are finished counting to infinity. The god of magic agrred to this bet with confidence but on the night of the performance Kumbaka was nowhere to be found. Kumbaka had actually preformed in a different plane of existence which bought him enough time to finish his preformance before he could be found. Kumbaka knows that the god is almost done counting to infinity amd is planning one last show three years from now. In his life Kumbaka had learned to play 13 instruments and can speak 6 different languages. Kumbaka is proud of his accomplishments and is ready to die.
        The Hermit of the Glade: No one knows how old he is, but he has always been there, and will always be there. His house is well maintained, though of low quality. For some reason no one ever bothers him, and few even bother to visit. He is always polite, helpful and could even be called friendly by those who have tried to visit. Perhaps he is some old man blessed/cursed with immortality, or perhaps there’s more to his story.
        The Beast: A boar that has lived in the underdark for 1000 years. He was ordinary boar that grew too large. Throughout the ages hunters have tried to slay The Beast, but none have triumphed. The Beast has only grown, both in size and hatred. His thick hide bristles with the spears and blades of the hunters and warriors it has bested.
        Früdwark The Elder Giant: no one is sure if Früdwark is a storm giant or a separate breed of giant entirely. Früdwark is by far the largest and oldest giant known to giant kind. Früdwark has no concern for other giants, dragons, or mortals and simply wants to be left alone. Früdwark has a distaste for dragons especially because dragons seem to be the creatures that are always trying to pester him the most. Früdwark has been known to make deals with mortals so that they can stop bothering him and so that they can kill dragons who bother him.
        Filtara: the oldest dracolich still alive. Filtara was the creature that had taught mortals to achieve lichdom at the cost of their servitude. Filtara was betrayed by her servants and was banished to an endless void somewhere in the shadowfell. When Filtara escapes her prison she will plan to make all humanoids extinct for what they have done to her.
        Ythandr: a pit fiend that owns the endless library which is a huge landmark in the nine layers of hell. The endless library is considered the library with the most books and information within its walls. Those who make too much noise in the library are swiftly dealt with by Ythandr. First time offenders are warned and left with a painful burn mark, second time offenders are taken to an area of the library simply labeled 'pain room'. It's a mystery what happens in the pain room but each offender spends 20 years in it and always leave with the parts of their brain pretaining to memory removed and given back to them in a jar. Ythandr is one of the very few devils that were born before the nine hells existed.
        The Trader: a quiet, strange being who pulls a cart full of strange magical items for no known reason. They wears a cloak that is always oily for some reason, a mask that completely hides their face, and large leather gauntlets that go up to their elbow. They only accepts other magic items of equal value for trade, and their stock is completely random, one day they may have only a +1 dagger, the next they may have multiple +5 vorpal swords. They are immune to all magical effects, including any forms of divination. If a PC asks a god or being with similar power about them, the god/other being will have no clue who they are talking about. They are friendly to the party, but will refuse to leave their cart or reveal any skin no matter what.
        The Poison Tree: The Primal Aspect of Knowledge, both good and ill. Uncovering new information is to be celebrated, even when it brings about ruin. Some scholars believe the tree is purely a metaphor, written about to conceptualize complex ideas in a primitive age; some believe it to be real, and strike out on lifelong journeys to find it and eat of its fruit.
        Eros: Referred to as 'The Mother of Monsters' in common parlance, this entity shares its name with the later goddess of love, though Eros is far more primal. It is love and lust in all of its forms, and its offspring and faithful are hybrids of monsters and humanoid species. Violent and terrible, the Forbidden Plateu of the Cult of Eros is home to rare species of beast and plant life. The very air there is said to corrupt mortals beyond recognition, twisting them into amalgams of man and monster.
        The Iron Pillar: Deep in the earth, it sings an endless song to all who dig toward it, though they do not understand it. Those who find it, fall to their knees in worship and expire in mortal terror.
        The Pig: a very strong woman with the head of a boar. The Pig can be found anywhere and everywhere as long as there is dim light. The Pig is a lawful neutral being that punishes those who try to defile the laws of nature. The Pig is said to be a failed experiment on how to prevent hunger but why the entity has lived for such a long time is beyond explanation. Those who have been killed by the hands of The Pig are found with no face and black ooze bubbling from a hole in their chest.
        The Yawning Willow: A sentient tree that speaks via the wind blowing through its leaves. The Yawning Willow is so old that it invented the language of druidic and has taught some of the first druids the ways of nature.
        Rinoir: he uses the body of a human once sworn in pact to Rinoir, now an avatar to him, as a demonic machine that has twelve mechanical arms protruding from the human’s old, withered, and blackened corpse. Rinoir is desperate to find a new host as his current one is getting more and more fragile as each year goes by.
        The Duke of Stone: a 20 foot tall being made of various stones and metals. The Duke of Stone is near impossible to describe due to their alien nature but some defining features are its many eyes and sharp, jagged body (if that even is a body at all). The Duke of Stone is a creature who takes joy in learning of its prey before petrifying them and engulfing their stone body into its horrendous figure. The Duke is always joking about how it 'eats' and 'sleeps' like a fleshbag, thinking of any creature smaller than him as a toy.
        Qpljhyt: an entity made of a pink fleshy substance that forms into a circle.

When the makeshift tomb was finally unsealed, all that was found besides bones and dust was a single sea snail, dull and healthy. It MIGHT be the cerebrilith Yiith, morphed into this inconspicuous form as a disguise or a side-effect of absorbing the god's magic.

        The Illumin: They are not known to engage with humans openly. But now and then, those who went spelunking or miners trapped in caves found themselves either led out by a mysterious light being. Or sometimes, led deeper in. The stories told around them are often suggestive that when someone becomes trapped in the dark, they measure a person by whether or not they bring light to others. Then choose to appear and lead them to whatever the Illumin wish them to see. Perhaps it is safety or their end. But whether or not the beings truly gauge such things or if they are each with their own whims and choices is not known to mortals. The Illumin themselves are creatures of the dark, deep, and below places. They are often compared to feyfolk or changelings but some scholars have theorized they share things in common with bioluminscent cave mushrooms or spores. They disappear in areas of light, and can shape themselves as they wish. Another more accepted theory is that they are the result of hallucinations and that they do not truly exist.

The gods knew that while they could stop his horrid new form from arising they couldn’t help but watch as the abomination unfolded before their eyes out of morbid curiosity. The forgotten king has been cursed for 500,00 years now and looks like a deformed werewolf, having one hand being larger than the other, a horn protruding from his eye socket, sickly white colored fur, and pure white eyes. The Forgotten King has never transcended into godhood for the other gods refused to allow it. He now waits in his castles ruins waiting for his daughter (who’s been dead for many many centuries) to come back from her coronation as princess (an event that happened when he was still happy).

        Asherl-Khan, The Guilt of Gods - Khan, the former god of glory, was slain and reanimated as this undead husk of a god. Khan's artifact, The Mantle of Glory was also transformed into The Mantle of Guilt which now exhales an impossibly black fog that reanimates the fallen and converts undead into following Asherl-Khan's will. The other gods were too ashamed to face their former friend and thus had Sigil's Lady of Pain seal him away in one of her mazes.

She has outlived her children, grand children, great grandchildren and so on for so many generations, but the pain of loss just doesn't seem to dissipate. This has left her a bitter old woman. She holds intimate knowledge of ancient societies because, well, she lived there and she often yearns for the 'good old days' when only sorcerers could make fire and magic couldn't be learned by any idiot who could open a book. She has attempted and failed at ending her own life and having it ended for her by provocation, but recently she has altered her strategy in life and is using her knowledge to indugle in a little necromancy. If she won't die, then neither will her great-great-great-great-great-great-grand children. If she succeeds, she will be united with her huge extended, risen again, family.

Regardless of their form, the Walker is always found walking down a road or path, surrounded by golden motes of light. They have never been seen leaving or arriving anywhere. If the Walker is spoken to politely, they will reply and offer to grant the person 'a light to watch their path'. When the person accepts, one of the lights that surround the Walker will start orbiting them instead, and will keep doing so until they die (when it flies off in a straight line, presumably back to the Walker.) If questioned about the direction of their journey or why they have lived so long, they will reply, 'Does the walker choose the path, or the path the walker?'

It has no bowels and everything it devours comes right through it, chewed and dropped from between all tangled sinews and veins that hang from its stump of a neck, all resembling grotesque tentacles and pseudopods. Melezabeth is mostly immobile, sitting atop of the ancient bottomless well, losing all its meals to the void beneath it. It can crawl, albeit very slowly. It can't be satiated, even with the help of its many cultists, which sacrifice countless victims to Melezabeth's all-devouring maw. Its minions suckle black goo from its disguisting arteries, like lambs of an undead goat, which gives them supernatural strength to do Melezabeth's bidding. They say the head has hypnotic abilities and when fought, it will often cannibalize its minions to instantly regenerate portions of health, catching prey with veiny tentacles and shooting nauseating goo from its swollen body.

Two elderly humans can occasionally be seen, puttering about the garden, milking the sheep, or caring for the cottage in some way. Ancient tomes and beings with such knowledge describe them simply as The Husband and The Wife, but that is largely the entirety of knowledge about them. They, or similar beings, have lived in The Cottage unchanged for millennia. The bubble in which they exist is utterly unbreachable, even by divine power or spells that effect the nature of reality itself, such as Wish. Any attempts to reach the inside of the bubble result in the breacher being hurled from the area with insane speed and force. Anyone attempting to contact the couple through the bubble will be greeted with friendly nods and waves, but no other attempts at communication.

The light temple is filled with light and magic based puzzles. The night temple is filled with dangers and fights taking place in magical darkness. At the end of each, she is sitting upon a throne. Small and frail but radiating with power. In the light, she will answer any three questions you ask, three answers, two truths, and one falsehood. In the dark, she will answer one question per individual, but the answer always rings true, and the asker may not like the answer. After a group leaves her temples, they will not open their doors again for anyone for 1,000 cycles of sun and moon.

    Warrior
        DThis warrior fights with
        a brandistock, cunningly designed so that if it is twisted just right it will shoot out its blade like an arrow.
        an arquebus with an axe-head affixed to its stock for desperate close combat.
        a broadsword and buckler. Both have seen more combat than the warrior has, and wear it in their scars.
        a steel-shod club.
        a poleaxe with a head shaped like a grinning skull.
        a pike with a gilded tip.
        a serrated scimitar.
        a morning star with its head shaped to resemble a hedgehog.
        A sabre and its scabbard, which is sturdy enough to be used as a bludgeon and parrying tool.
        a partizan adorned with bloodstained feathers.
        a brace of pistols and a pair of daggers.
        a wavy flammenschwert.
        a tower shield painted with a roaring lion, and a long flail that can strike around it.
        a composite bow. They’ve notched vulgar insults into the shafts of all their arrows.
        a spear and kite shield. The spear bears a notch for everyone it’s killed, the shield for every time it’s saved the warrior’s life.
        a halberd with a bird’s nest impaled on its point.
        a glaive elaborated decorated to resemble a wickedly thorned rose.
        a rapier and a long knife.
        a sling with lead shot, and a seax for when the enemy gets close.
        a warhammer. Its head is shaped like an anvil.
        DThis warrior fights in
        clanking old half-plate.
        a corroded coat of chains.
        iron scale-mail molded to look like a pangolin’s armour.
        treated textiles tough enough to offer some protection, dyed in abstract patterns.
        mismatched pieces of armour taken off a dozen different bodies on a dozen different battlefields.
        rattling, ill-fitted lorica segmentata.
        roughly-stitched, muddy hides from animals large and small, furry and scaly.
        a breastplate polished to a bright sheen, and poofy brocaded silk sleeves.
        plates of shell and chitin pried from the flanks of man-eating war-beasts.
        a shredded mail hauberk with arrowheads inextricably stuck in its rings.
        a burgonet, jackboots, and boiled leather.
        splinted steel vambraces and greaves, a rusty coat of plates.
        an enamelled crimson cuirass.
        barding meant for a horse, hammered out to fit them.
        lacquered lamellar.
        a cloak reinforced with light metal plates, with chains wrapped around their forearms to help parry.
        leather trousers, hobnailed boots, and woad war-paint.
        an Almain rivet with a couple missing and dented plates.
        mirror armour, its central chest disc molded to resemble an open palm.
        a brigandine coat, its cloth soiled and torn.
        This warrior fights for
        a queen long dead, a country that no longer exists.
        the ecstatic trance they enter in the heat of battle, unmatched by any other pleasure they’ve experienced.
        revenge against the whole of the world.
        just enough pay to get them high.
        the fulfilment of their unconscious deathwish, so that they may join their fallen comrades.
        the perfection of their technique, so that they may teach the next generation of warriors.
        the only god who ever answered their prayers, a bloody and rapacious thing.
        no other reason than it comes easily to them.
        the chance to stare into someone’s eyes as they die.
        an escape from the bonds of civilized society.
        an outlet for their sublimated frustrations.
        a plot of land they dream of retiring to.
        the chance to find an old enemy on the battlefield and finish their feud.
        the sake of accumulating sin to join their damned love in the hereafter.
        a fiery and uncompromising faith.
        the approval of a father no longer able to grant it.
        accolades and trophies.
        the funds to found a warrior’s paradise.
        the satiation of a curse which demands they spill ten drops of guilty blood for every drop of innocent blood they’ve taken, or else suffer unimaginably as their veins smoulder from within.
        the naked truth they believe to be revealed in life-or-death situations.
        DThis warrior stands out on the battlefield
        for their obstinate ferocity. They have never retreated from a battle without being dragged by their companions.
        for their blood-curdling war-shouts.
        for their calm and clear sight even in the thickest fog of war.
        for the elegant execution of their enemies.
        for the technical precision of their fighting.
        for their graceful, dance-like movements.
        for their unpredictable speed.
        for their brutal strength.
        for their numb resistance to pain and wounds.
        for their disrespect to fallen opponents.
        because they seek out the strongest-seeming foes to fight.
        because of their towering height and abnormal reach.
        for the nigh-impassable wall that is their guard.
        for their opportunistic hit-and-run tactics.
        for their impeccable observation of proper battlefield decorum, and fair treatment of prisoners.
        for the way their charismatic presence lends their fellows courage.
        because of the sweet scent of the perfume they douse themself with before every battle.
        for the way they can predict their opponents and plan ten moves in advance.
        for the sheer dumb luck they must have to survive their own clumsiness.
        for their dirty tricks and unflappable wit.
        DWhen this warrior cries out in their sleep they are reliving
        the moment they squandered an entire campaign’s worth of pay on an ill-advised gamble.
        the beatings they suffered at the hands of their mentor.
        when they had to hide among the reeking dead and were trampled beneath them all the same.
        a duel they lost by their overconfidence, and survived only due to cowardice.
        a campaign they marched for so long they forgot the smell of home.
        a rout so total that more were killed by the weight of their fleeing comrades than were on the blades of the enemy.
        a combat fought in tunnels so close you couldn’t swing a sword.
        a battle fought within fading firelight, those at the sputtering edge picked off by blind enemies.
        an ambush when they were caught wading waist-deep through mud.
        a terrible trip they suffered because of the hallucinogenic venom smeared along an enemy’s weapon.
        the moment they realized they were going to live and die by the sword.
        a fight against a monster no mortal weapons could scratch.
        the moment they received a wound whose scar still aches even all these years later.
        the turning point of a battle when those they thought were steadfast allies betrayed them.
        a time they thought they’d found peace fell into chaos once more.
        the loss of their dear love while they were away on campaign.
        the long sickness that wasted away their hard-earned strength.
        the civil schism that turned them against their brother.
        when a priest cursed the warrior with their last breath.
        the moment they sold out their comrades who planned to desert their army.

Fiend Contract fine print
    The signatory has to carry a device that pulls energy from them, charging it. It radiates with heat (not damaging) and glows red at night or when demihumans are near.

    The signatory must become the hive for a nest of dire hornets.

    The signatory must throw 25% of all gold they earn into the sea (or appropriate way to lose it based on the contract). If they gain items for any reason, the 25% of the item can be taken as a substitute tax.

    Two nights a week, the signatory is not allowed to sleep. The sleep they would get is transferred to an unnamed slumbering creature that requires a set amount of slumber before awakening. The signatory gains a level of exhaustion after each of these nights.

    Everyone forgets an event in which the signatory participated.

    From now on, another creature will take all the credit for the signatory's deeds.

    The signatory must babysit the contract-holder’s nephew. Any damage sustained to the child will be dealt to them with a 5 second delay (the next combat round). Healing, unfortunately, does not transfer in the same way.

    The contract specifies that the signatory must break a fellow demon out of a prison in heaven within the next 30 days. Failure to bring the demon home and in stable, living condition means the demon can possess the signatory's body and use it as a vessel.

    The signatory signs over the rights to all of their teeth, and all future teeth they may acquire through any means.

    The signatory agrees that at any time they can be teleported to the contract owner's location and provide a foot massage. The massage will not last longer than 10 minutes.

    At any time, any place, under any circumstance, the fiend may plane shift the signatory to their home plane for one minute, as a workplace-exchange program sponsored by the fiend’s superiors. A fiend of similar power to the signatory replaces the signatory for the time period. Per the conditions of the contract, any such interplanar travel is voluntary for the signatory, and cannot be resisted.

    The signatory owes a tithe of blood each day. Signatory takes 1d4 damage at dusk each day. Any class features or magic used to prevent the damage will void the contract, and the fiend will be free to go.

    At the start of any combat, the signatory must make a DC13 Wisdom save or be frightened of the enemy combatants for 1 minute. The signatory can make another save at the beginning of their turn each round to resist the effect.

    The fiend will assist the signatory in combat, but only attacks when the signatory takes damage.

    The fiend narrates the signatory's every move, providing inner monologues as well. The narration is not necessarily true. Signatory has disadvantage on stealth and deception checks.

    The signatory's mundane weapons become enchanted, acting as magical weapons. However, only the fiend may wield them on their behalf. The signatory or their companions cannot use them.

    Other fiends regularly appear to the signatory, urging them to sign their own contracts. Apparently, the signatory's agreeable nature is attractive to fiends…

    All other contracts previously signed by the signatory are now null and void. House deeds, bank accounts, and loan debt are all lost, though a warlock pact is strong enough to resist this nullification.

    The signatory's left and right hands completely swap. This doesn’t have much of a mechanical effect, but some might think they are a Rakshasa.

    The signatory and their nearest sibling switch names. (If they are an only child, swap names with mother or father). 

    Minor spouts of what some would call “stage magic” happen involuntarily. Each time the signatory fails a Constitution saving throw, roll on the table below (1d6) (or DM’s choice) to see what happens.
    A crow flies out of their mouth (50% chance to be dead and skeletal)

    Their footprints glow with iridescent paint for one hour.

    Their head falls off, and they must use their reaction to catch it. If they do not have a reaction remaining, take 1d12 necrotic damage.

    All of their bones crack, dealing 1d8 thunder damage to you and half as much to any creature within 5 feet.

    Invisible three-quarters cover appears between them and the 5-foot space in front of them.

    All the currency in their pockets appears in their hand. If you do not have a free hand, it falls at their feet.

    Whenever signing further contracts, the signatory must ask to be paid in slaves, in addition to or instead of any other reward. When a sufficient number of slaves is reached, a fiend will arrive to take them away and the contract will be fulfilled.  

    The signatory must fully abstain from (insert their favorite food, drink, or substance).

    Each time the signatory get a full night's rest, they take on the appearance of someone else.

    At any point, the fiend may take control of the signatory's body. Having signed, the victim may get a saving throw, but passing it would be a breach of contract. For one day, the fiend has complete control of the body. The signatory is in the equivalent of a deep coma. Usually there may be additional clauses, limiting what the fiend is allowed to do, e.g.: can't harm the body, or make it do clearly suicidal things, or directly attack the signatory's allies, but is otherwise free to use it as they please. 

    The signatory isn’t allowed to enter any type of contract, alliance or agreement with good-aligned churches or entities, without the explicit permission of the fiend. 

    A clone of the signatory will appear. The original and the clone will both be convinced they are the real one, with the same ability and memories, and only high-level magic will be able to tell them apart. 

    The signatory loses the ability to read.

    The signatory permanently loses one or more of the following senses: smell, hearing, touch, taste, the ability to perceive temperature, the ability to feel pain, the ability to keep rhythm. 

    When the time comes where the signatory can vote, their vote will be determined by the contract owner.

    The signatory loses the ability to deceive. The signatory can lie, or omit the truth, but the contract holder will correct them and notify the other party of the lie.

    They inexplicably become obsessed with a new hobby. The need to explore this hobby is as compelling as their previously favorite activity.

    The signatory is now betrothed to a family member of the contract holder (a fiend, of course). In 90 days, planar immigration authorities will give the signatory and their betrothed a test to show they are indeed in love and know enough about each other. If either person fails the test, they will both be banished from this plane. If they succeed, the wedding will take place within 24 hours. Failure to show up to the wedding or refuse the marriage will result in banishment as well.

    The signatory will be transported to the contract owner’s position in the event the contract owner is threatened.

    The signatory gives up their fertility and any other means of producing an offspring.

    The signatory must house a sentient parasite for one year. If the parasite does not survive, a new one will arrive and the year starts over.

    The signatory must listen to the contract owner’s nephew/niece’s band play their first show. This includes cheering when songs end, buying merch, and congratulating the band after finishing the show but before leaving the venue.

    The signatory must plan and execute an amazing surprise birthday party for an entity/person/creature/or other specified consciousness or concept of the contract owner’s choosing.

    The signatory must replace one of their eyes with the contract owner’s eyes (contract owner’s choice of which eyes). Both parties will be able to see through the replacement eye.

    The signatory must convince the contract owner’s parent said parent is wrong about a particular issue of the contract owner’s choice. 

    The signatory must act irrationally towards certain people or groups of people, chosen beforehand. The signatory is required to act foolishly, be very annoying or hectic, and never explain their action to anybody. 

    The signatory must wear a necklace of severed fingers, and isn’t allowed to hide it under clothes or conceal it in any way.

    The signatory must pay for 10 guards to comprise the contract holder's bodyguard. These count as elite troops or skilled labor for purposes of daily wages (ex. 3g/day/person, in 5e DMG terms).

    After the term of contract is up, the signatory must serve the contract holder as a dually bonded mercenary for the same term of time. The fiend will very likely employ the signatory as a bodyguard, or as a line troop in the Blood War.

    The contract holder must receive one good-aligned sacrifice every new moon, or quarter, if the world has no moons. If an evil-aligned creature is sacrificed instead, the contract holder becomes beholden to the sacrificial creature. If the sacrifice is forgotten or otherwise missed, the contract is void, and the contract holder attacks the signatory in an attempt to kill and steal their soul.

    The signatory must open a gate to the contract holder's home plane within a year and a day of signing the contract.

    The signatory must betray the trust of someone they love. This must happen during the period of the contract.

    The signatory must intentionally lose a public fight against the contract holder, at a time and location chosen by the contract holder. The signatory must put up a believable and convincing act.

    Any healing magic cast upon the signatory is now split with the contract holder, with half of the HP value going to each. Any regeneration from items is also split between them. Resurrection or restoration magic works as normal. This effect lasts through the duration of the contract.

    The signatory begins to gain weight inexplicably. Nine months to the day after signing, the signatory gives birth to the contract holder's spawn. This happens regardless of the signatory's gender. The signatory loses half their HP, and gains three levels of exhaustion during the ordeal.
