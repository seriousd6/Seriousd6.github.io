    shops
            what kind of shop is this?
            bank, or another sort of financial institution
            smithy or manufactory
            drover/caravansary
            kiln/glassworks
            university or other institution of learning
            hospital or some sort of healer
            a crafter such as a tailor or haberdashery
            an artist, such as a painter, sculptor or poet. 50% chance of having a patron.
        
        how's the business doing?
            collapsing. whether through the incompetence of the owner(s) or outside factors, the business is falling apart and is likely up to it's eyes in debt.
            dwindling. the flow of customers or clients has almost dried up completely, though this may be the fault of the owner, rather than the community dying.
            steady. the business is profitable, but not so much that the proprietor is well to do.
            steady. the business is profitable, but not so much that the proprietor is well to do.
            steady. the business is profitable, but not so much that the proprietor is well to do.
            busy. the day is constantly packed with things to do, people to help.
            growing. customers or clients find that they have to schedule in advance to get service. the business is looking for more help.
            bustling. there's more work than there are hands, and any new clients will have trouble getting what they want in a timely manner
        
        who runs the place?
            a family business, perhaps the founder is still alive, but just as likely it has been going for several generations.
            a number of proprietors, perhaps only a pair, but maybe as large as a board.
            a sole owner, who may or may not have any employees.
            a distant and far away owner, such as a merchant prince or a noble. they likely have local representatives to look after their interests.
            the business is ran by the local government, or is an extension of a government monopoly.
            a cooperative or group of merchants, teachers or workers run the business.
            the ownership is contested. this certainly does not bode well for the future.
            ownership of the business is unclear or actively obfuscated.

        what is unique about it?
            the owner is getting the majority of their stock or funding from an illegitimate source, such as from smugglers or by acting as a front.
            the product or training that the business provides is widely considered to be somehow corrupt or scandalous in some way locally. patronizing it marks you as someone willing to overlook that reputation.
            the business has paid protection money to local criminals. any harassment or theft on the premises is going to be met with serious reprisals.
            the business or institution is famous; they could have made some legendary item or trained or saved some notable personage.
            due to reasons inscrutable to those on the outside, the business is only open during certain times, such as during the night or certain seasons.
            doing business here is bound by some custom that may not only be immediately obvious, they may only accept patronage from a certain ethnicity, social class or faith.
            coin is not accepted here, only barter or service.
            the business has no set locale or storefront, they may even serve several nearby communities as well.
    
    prison
        "so what's the lowdown on this place?"
            bars, stones, cells and blocks. a typical penitentiary.
            bars, stones, cells and blocks. a typical penitentiary.
            bars, stones, cells and blocks. a typical penitentiary.
            somewhere desolate and isolated, perhaps the side of a mountain or the endless expanse of the steppe. no bars are necessary because there's nowhere to go.
            a slum or segregated area of either an existing city or structure, or perhaps one now given over entirely to the purpose. the area is walled off and the perimeter guarded.
            exile. prisoners are dropped off on some (supposedly) uninhabited island. they're likely still under a watchful eye, but it is much smaller than it otherwise would be.
            this place is more akin to a religious community than a true prison. prisoners are enrolled as initiates and are required to go through certain rituals to be released.
            the prison is a labor camp, perhaps prisoners are forced to work at various crafts, farm or they're simply on a chain gang.
        
        "how about the cons?"
            this is a place for hardened criminals - thieves, murderers, rapists and robbers. the folk here are likely violent and skilled in the ways of criminality
            this is a place for hardened criminals - thieves, murderers, rapists and robbers. the folk here are likely violent and skilled in the ways of criminality
            debtors, those who owe the powers that be enough that they've been thrown in gaol to work off their debts.
            political prisoners. folk who have fallen afoul of whatever temporal authority controls the penitentiary.
            the inmates here are prisoners of war, taken in battle or surrender.
            these souls are the victims of a religious purge or inquisition. they could be heretics, or they could be worshipers of an entirely other faith.
            this place was built to house a special kind of inmate, magic-users. it has additional layers of security, of course.
            they're ghosts. this place was meant to shackle the souls of condemned beyond the grave as a form of additional punishment.
        
        "what are the guards here like?"
            vicious and unrelenting, they are a well-paid monolith of authoritative violence.
            lazy and indolent, they will not notice all but the most egregious violations such as murders or escape attempts.
            they have been utterly co-opted by a criminal group; the true masters of this place are whomever you rolled for "how about the other cons?"
            the guards are prisoners themselves, generally those who earned trust through following the rules. the upper hierarchy may be normal guards, or perhaps there may be periodic checks to ensure that the population hasn't changed.
            members of a religious order dedicated to punishment or otherwise oppression of criminals and the condemned.
            the prison is guarded by wild animals and the elements. there may be border guards or occasional patrols, but they are few and far between
            there are only a few guards, but they are preternatural in some way, ranging from cerberoi and minotaur to spirits or elementals.
            there aren't any. some sort of eldritch force keeps people here, from a curse to even a form of spell.
        
        "what kind of help can i get here?"
            a snitch, with wary eyes and open ears. they're a fantastic source of information, but they may also be informing others about you.
            a smuggler, with connections to the outside and a means to get things in. smugglers will do most anything before revealing their sources.
            a tough, frightening and capable of coercing near anyone into compliance.
            a killer, skilled and predatory. willing to murder nearly anyone for the right price.
            a fixer, with the ears of the administration or the guards. they can arrange for the rules to be bent - for a favor.
            a crafter, able to take disparate materials and turn them into damn near anything, from weapons to drugs or drink.
            a kingpin, able to organize other prisoners (at least some of them) and to bend them towards their own ends.
            a seer, priest or other form of magic-user who is able to communicate with the outside, or if given the materials and seclusion, cast spells.
    
    the cruel presence
        where did they come from?
            veterans.
            rebels.
            bored gentry.
            foreign invaders.
            cultists/fanatics.
            indigenous population.
            criminal gang.
            government oppressors.
        
        how do they approach fighting?
            savage, all out attacks. the bandits will fight without regard to their safety or future.
            ambushes, supported by ranged weapons. these folk will run as soon as they are discovered or the tide turns against them.
            assassinations. skilled in stealth and infiltration, they will never commit to any sort of direct attack, nor will they be caught together as a group.
            cavalry, whether that be on the backs of horses, or something stranger like wolves or vehicles. they favor hit and run style tactics.
            disciplined tactics/planning. these are not mere bandits, but soldiers. they will use any and all means at their disposal to launch more effective attacks.
            unruly and ill-disciplined mobs. members fight and flee as individuals, trusting in their own judgments.
            performance. this is all an act to try and extract what they want. they act tough, but in reality they are cowards, who will flee at the slightest hint of trouble.
            swindlers. they do not attack in any direct way, but rather seek to get what they desire through guile and deception. they may pretend to be someone else, or try to worm their ways into the community.
        
        why are they here?
            plunder/wealth.
            purge.
            conquest.
            specific goal, like a person, piece of territory or item.
            generational rivalry.
            religiously motivated.
            political/civil conflict.
            under contract to do so.
        
        what is unique about them?
            someone important from a nearby community is an informant for the group in regards to the comings and goings there. they're far more aware of potential heists, targets or attempts at reprisals against them.
            these bandits employ animals or monsters, whether magical or otherwise, to help them with their work.
            the group is led by or is employing a spellcaster of some sort. they may have an enchanted item, or they may have the occasional back-up of the spell user.
            the brigands are led by a strange being such as a...1) dragon, 2) fiend, 3) celestial, 4) aberration.
            the bandits themselves are some strange or exotic beings themselves such as...1) undead, 2) time/dimensional travelers, 3) magically summoned, 4) underground dwellers.
            the marauder's hideout is somewhere near impossible for a small group to assault; a mountain fastness, a fort built upon a river sandbar, or a ship which simply sails away.
            the agents are drawn from the population of the town itself! a conspiracy of silence supports the members.
            they are not here of their own volition, they have been forced into their current position by disaster or ill-luck.

    the cult
        what kind of cult is this?
            based around a single charismatic individual.
            a mainline faith, pushed to extremes.
            a new faith or mystery, perhaps from a far away land or inspired locally.
            hereditary in nature, passed along family lines or just a single gender.
            keeps to the old one(s).
            a secret society, or another form of cryptic organization.
            decadent and listless, the members of this cult are in it for the thrill.
            a doomsday cult, these folk believe that the world is ending soon, if not any day.
        
        what are they trying to accomplish?
            a genuine exploration of their beliefs and inspirations. note that this could still have negative connotations.
            summoning something, like a(n)...1) aberration, 2) fiend, 3) people from the past/future/another dimension, 4) celestial.
            upheaval of the status quo or current government.
            engaging in some act unpalatable to the rest of society, like...1) cannibalism, 2) proscribed sexual acts, 3) excessive drug or alcohol use, 4) fight club.
            the death of some important figure, or more broadly, a faction.
            the destruction of a rival faith, or any other faith.
            support and enrichment of it's members, whether that be through legal or illegal means.
            exploitation of it's members; roll again and ignore this result if rolled again. the second result is what they tell to new recruits.
        
        where is their membership drawn from?
            ne'er do wells; criminals, beggars & transients.
            the elite of society.
            working class folk, the salt of the earth.
            all walks of life
            racially, culturally or ethnically exclusive.
            a certain profession, such as fisher folk, merchants or farmers.
            an isolated or otherwise insular folk.
            those who have been brainwashed, chosen or ensorcelled in some way.

        how do they operate?
            out in the open. they are passive, and unwilling to commit violence - unless their faith requires it.
            openly, with hostility and great abandon.
            clandestinely, with a vicious streak towards any who stumble upon them.
            covertly, those who discover them are met with bribes, cajoling and religious arguments.
            the cult attempts to masquerade as a more pedestrian organization.
            they recruit openly locally, but their true home is somewhere far away and hidden.
            through a cellular structure, each cell is kept ignorant of what the other is doing, but there is a secret architect lurking somewhere.
            coordinated through dreams, they move seemingly without communication.
    
    the major holiday
        what sort of holiday?
            religious, explicitly performing rituals and celebrations in regards to a faith.
            civic, sponsored by or in celebration of the prevailing government or society.
            cultural. a sort of blend of civic and religious holidays, cultural celebrations tend towards jovial atmospheres and often draw upon local folklore or legend.
            commemoration, set aside for mourning or celebrating some grand event.
            celestial, celebrating or noting something like an eclipse, lunar cycle, comet or similarly sidereal event.
            seasonal, focusing on the passage of one set of weather patterns for another.
            environmental, coinciding with the return of some plant or animal to the area.
            mixed. this day draws upon several sources, roll twice on this table and weld the results together.
        
        how widespread is observance?
            a particular faith, sect or culture.
            a particular faith, sect or culture.
            a particular faith, sect or culture.
            a small region such as a few villages or towns, perhaps even a city.
            a large region such as a kingdom or an empire.
            members of a certain profession or guild.
            members of a certain race or ethnicity.
            members of a certain race or ethnicity.

        what form do the proceedings take?
            public feasting, drinking and celebrations.
            public feasting, drinking and celebrations.
            people are gathered for stories, speeches, songs and other forms of public performance.
            people are gathered for stories, speeches, songs and other forms of public performance.
            a procession, from a civilized area to a ritual site.
            somber rituals, observances and sacrifices (whether they be living creatures or otherwise)
            a ritualized competition or combat that could range from bloodless sport to free-for-alls which result in the deaths of one or more participants.
            certain norms and taboos are meant to be challenged during this festival; perhaps folk dress opposite to their normal gender expression, act in strange or transgressive ways, or debts may be forced to be forgiven.
        
        how long does it last?
            only a few hours, such as during the daylight hours or through the night.
            an entire day.
            an entire day.
            an entire day.
            an entire day.
            several days.
            an entire week.
            a month.
    
    treasure
        who hid it? why?
            it was an accident, a shipment lost to random chance or calamity. for some reason it was never reclaimed.
            a noble family, displaced by a revolt or disaster, hid their secret somewhere only they could find it.
            a group of raiders or pirates, storing a score until it was safe to retrieve it.
            members of a religious minority, fleeing persecution.
            an extremely powerful figure, such as a culture hero or particularly skilled spellcaster.
            the treasure was part of a tontine or related to the retirement of the members. everyone died before anyone could retrieve it.
            the society surrounding the hidden treasure collapsed, and its location was forgotten.
            the treasure was important in some way -- perhaps it was the site of votive offerings, or the location of a guild's vault -- and it was guarded. while most of it's sentinels have died or vanished, some may still be guarding it.

        where does it lead to?
            an isolated and deserted island.
            deep inside a cave or another subterranean region.
            a religious site, such as a temple or a shrine.
            the middle of nowhere, a barren place, far from any civilization.
            inside an urban area, currently inhabited or reduced to deserted ruins.
            the bottom of the ocean or a lake.
            a castle in the sky.
            a celestial body, such as a planet or other plane of existence.

        and what's hidden there?
            riches! glittering gold and prizes. the intrepid explorers receive (3d100 x 5) gp.
            riches! glittering gold and prizes. the intrepid explorers receive (3d100 x 5) gp.
            riches! glittering gold and prizes. the intrepid explorers receive (3d100 x 5) gp.
            pandora's lament. an extremely powerful monster has been bound to this site. opening where it is held releases it.
            cache of weapons - 50% chance to be magical, 50% chance to be make of an exotic material such as silver, obsidian or ivory.
            cache of weapons - 50% chance to be magical, 50% chance to be make of an exotic material such as silver, obsidian or ivory.
            cultural artifacts and personal effects. worthless to most, priceless to the right buyers.
            magical paraphernalia such as scrolls and potions, maybe even a spellbook.
        
        what form does the map take?
            the classic treasure map. made of vellum, inked, and showing off a simple guide to the terrain leading to and around the score. 50% chance that the map is in multiple parts
            the map is relatively well-known regionally and it takes the form of a local legend such as a story, poem or song.
            a strange and bizarre device, such as a potion which makes one recall the memories of one of the people who hid it.
            a cipher, puzzle or some other form of riddle.
            the map is hidden within the patterns of a natural feature, such as a set of holes within a hillside, or the shadows of a grove of trees.
            one of the people (or a descendant of one) responsible for hiding the treasure is spilling the location to people. the party are certainly not the only ones who have caught wind of it.
            the map is split between a number of people, no more than a half-dozen, all of whom have a piece of it.
            there is no map - there are only the remaining notes (and possibly spirits) of those who hid it. they must be searched or interrogated for the location.

    disaster
        what caused this?
            random accident has conspired against the community. no one in particular is responsible.
            random accident has conspired against the community. no one in particular is responsible.
            random accident has conspired against the community. no one in particular is responsible.
            random accident has conspired against the community. no one in particular is responsible.
            the gods themselves have been offended. a sacrifice was not made, a sacred animal or a priest was murdered, or someone has committed some other terrible transgression. further recompense may be necessary.
            a dark ritual or curse is targeting the community. the calamity may the goal or merely a side-effect. this may only be a prelude.
            a prophecy has come to pass. it was written in the ancient scrolls, and you were fools to have ignored them.
            this is a knock-on effect, of another disaster. roll again, adding another catastrophe on top of the first.
        
        what kind of catastrophe is it?
            an invasion, whether in the form of bandits, a foreign foe or even something as pedestrian as locusts or weevils.
            plague, deadly enough that healing magic has no means to arrest it.
            a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami or volcanic eruption.
            climate related disaster, such as an unusually long and intense rainy season, or a parching drought.
            a weather related event, such as a tornado, hurricane or wild fire.
            an explicitly magical event, such as a sourceless tune which forces listeners to dance or the dead beginning to rise from their graves.
            blight and pestilence. it leads to the the death of any crops and livestock which are afflicted.
            a bizarre and fortean event, such as a rain of frogs or the waters within a river or lake turning to blood.
        
        what is the scale of the devastation?
            only a few families, or perhaps a couple of buildings.
            the equivalent of a small town or village.
            the equivalent of a small town or village.
            a city, or several villages or towns.
            a city, or several villages or towns.
            an entire region or province.
            an entire region or province.
            the entirety of a country, empire or kingdom.
        
        how is the community dealing with this?
            nonchalance. this event is a regular occurrence, to the point where most folk pay it no mind.
            a doomsayer has appeared, promising to solve what vexes the community if they merely commit a few unspeakable acts. people are listening.
            mild panic. there are runs on stores, hoarding and small bouts of interpersonal violence, but no breakdown in law and order.
            mild panic. there are runs on stores, hoarding and small bouts of interpersonal violence, but no breakdown in law and order.
            severe panic. looting, burning, combat in the streets.
            open revolution. the followers are blaming the leaders, and are planning on holding them responsible through violent means.
            mass exodus. everyone flees the area as fear seizes them.
            resignation and apathy have overtaken them. the disaster seems inevitable, so they no longer see the point in struggling.

            a number of people; this can be as few as a pair, as many as a conspiracy. roll 1d6+1, that's the number of conspirators. roll again on this table that many times, ignoring this result and the previous (unless you'd like the possibility of dune level shenanigans)
        
        how'd they do it?
            an animal, whether it be magical or otherwise. kicked them in the head with a horse, had a dog maul them, hid a basilisk in their closet...
            a directed weapon, from a candlestick, knife or firearm - perhaps even just a large rock - the variations are endless, but the results are the same.
            something which initially seems like an accident; a fall, drowning, or an overturned candle turned inferno.
            with their bare hands, by strangling or beating them to death.
            poison, whether in their food, drink, or something more exotic.
            a trap, whether that be a literal booby trap or sabotage to make something mundane into something dangerous.
            deprivation; this can be by starvation, dehydration or exposure. this also generally implies some sort of imprisonment or form of restraints.
            magic. a spell, a magical item, a curse, or some other manifestation of unnatural power.
        
        why'd they do it?
            money
            romantic differences
            fury
            religious reasons
            compulsion - magical or otherwise.
            property
            secrets
            accident and cover-up

            the culmination of the efforts of generations of scholars.
            author was taken by a eerie mood and wrote the work in a fortnight.

            tangles of intricate ropes and beads in a language that may not still be known. may be read in the dark.
            a puzzle box or similar device. the secrets within are whispered into the mind of those who solve it.
            scrimshawed upon the bones of a(n)...1: humanoid, 2: outsider, 3: aberration, 4: monster. may be read in the dark.

        what kind of lore is inside?
            the true names of...1: celestials, 2: fiends, 3: genies, 4: fae.
            exhaustively indexed knowledge on an extremely niche topic such as elven architecture or goblin poetry. worth a small amount to most, but a huge sum to the right collector.
            a creeping form of madness which provides insight into the world. in exchange for losing one's mind permanently, the bearer of the work may ask it questions and gain answers 1d6 times per day as if they were using the spells find the path, augury, identify or clairaudience.
            a compendium covering the habits and weaknesses of...1: outsiders, 2: aberrations, 3: magical creatures, 4: undead.

        is it trapped or have guardians?
            animates a mouth upon its surface and bites those who try to read it without the proper password. 1d6+3 bludgeoning damage. bites again every 2d10 rounds.
            lets out a blood-curdling scream and flies away at 60' turn if read anywhere except...1: under the stars, 2: within a chamber with no natural light, 3: upon unworked earth, 4: a place of spiritual significance.
            locked. if an attempt is made to force it open it begins to weep gallons upon gallons of...1: blood, 2: ink, 3: water, 4: ichor.
            the work is a keystone or plug of sorts, if removed or reproduced then...1: the area containing the work shakes itself to bits in 1d6 minutes, 2: undead begin to appear around where the work is held, 3: animals of all stripes become hostile to whomever bears it, 4: bad luck follows the bearer, the referee may impose disadvantage on 1d2 rolls per day at their discretion.
            a cult or religious order is dedicated to safeguarding the work in some way. if it is stolen of copied without consent then they will surely seek to rectify the situation.
            magically bound to defend the work in some way until their destruction, the guardian takes the form of a(n)...1: powerful undead creature, 2: outsider, 3: monster, 4: construct.

            the work itself is famous. while there is no one specifically looking for it, the very news of it changing hands may attract unwanted attention to those who now have it.

    mercenary/ military
        what kind of warriors are these?
            light infantry, trained to do battle loose-order and to fight as raiders, scouts and skirmishers. they are equipped with a mix of ranged and melee weapons.
            heavy infantry, troops meant to fight in pitched battle and in line, these folk are equipped with the heaviest weapons and armor that they can afford.
            light cavalry possessed of fleets mounts and raged weapons. these troops are talented marauders and scouts and will eagerly run down any retreating enemies.
            heavy cavalry, meant to shatter the enemy with brutal charges. these mounted warriors are heavily armed and armored, with mounts large and powerful enough to carry them.
            a siege train, which includes transports, specialists and ammunition. these could take the form of cannon, rams, sappers or even stranger things.
            ranged troops, whether they are equipped with bows, crossbows or firearms, these soldiers will do their best to stay far away from the enemy and pepper them with missiles.
            privateers, using whatever kind of vessel is appropriate for the setting. most commonly this means a sea-going ship, but this could also mean a river vessel or even something more exotic like an airship.
            a mixed force, roll twice on this table (ignoring this result if it comes up again) to determine what kind of soldiers make up this varied unit.
        
        how numerous are they?
            a small handful, perhaps just a dozen
            several squads, comprising a couple of units and several dozen troops.
            a company, including several officers, which number a little over a hundred in total.
            a cohort, hundreds of battle-ready soldiers and their attendant camp followers.
            a cohort, hundreds of battle-ready soldiers and their attendant camp followers.
            a brigade or legion, several thousand soldiers, along with their support staff, commanders and wagon train.
            a brigade or legion, several thousand soldiers, along with their support staff, commanders and wagon train.
            a veritable army, comprising ~20-30,000 soldiers, along with command staff and various support troops.

        who leads them?
            a noble, fallen from glory and perhaps even exiled from the land of their birth. their leader is likely skilled at both battle and diplomacy, but they are consumed by bitterness from their state and will likely do nearly anything to rectify it.
            these troops mutinied against their officers, and are commanded by the former ringleaders. the ringleaders have grouped themselves into a council, and will vote on important decisions. discipline and uniformity is likely lax.
            a soldier's soldier, someone who has fought their way through countless campaigns and has risen to a position of command. they are likely skilled in the arts of war and death, but lack tact.
            a member of the nobility in good standing. their troops are likely drawn from lands the noble's family controls. the noble isn't likely a mere adventurer, they are looking to advantage their family or themselves.
            these are mercenaries in name only, they are barely better than bandits in behavior and their leader is no exception. likely a vicious killer themselves, the commander of this band keeps control through violence and bribery.
            founded as a money-making endeavor, the commander of this group is more akin to a merchant than a warrior. the leader is likely skilled at negotiating contracts and sniffing out profitable battles.
            led by a devout worshipper of a deity, the troops have been enticed or forced into the worship of their commander's god. whether or not their devotion is true, their leader's is, and they will use the miracles granted by their deity to help them in battle.
            a spellcaster, known for their strange and often baffling ways, leads this group by dint of their abilities. they will aid their folk with spells and mystical knowledge.

        how skilled are they? are they loyal?
            rabble, hardly a cut above levies. they are cowards, who will run if the battle goes against them (-2 to all morale checks), they are however extremely cheap (-40% to costs)
            decently trained and equipped, but they lack motivation (-1 to all morale checks) and they have little care towards their own reputations. they will betray their employer if given a better offer.
            average pay for average skill. they have been trained to acceptable standards, but are nothing special beyond having a reputation for loyalty.
            average pay for average skill. they have been trained to acceptable standards, but are nothing special beyond having a reputation for loyalty.
            average pay for average skill. they have been trained to acceptable standards, but are nothing special beyond having a reputation for loyalty.
            well drilled and disciplined (+1 to all morale checks) troops with an iron-shod reputation.
            the elite, the cream of the crop (+2 to all morale checks, +1 all attack rolls). they are brave and unshakably loyal, but they are hideously expensive (+40% to costs)
            elite (+2 to all morale checks, +1 all attack rolls) soldiers who know all too well their own worth. they cost more (+20% to costs) but that coin does not win their loyalty. they fight for whoever pays them most, even switching sides in the midst of battle.
