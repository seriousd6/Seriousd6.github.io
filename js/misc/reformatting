Odd Items
    A cigarette lighter etched with symbols of the sea and whaling. its a large curved bone with a flint-wheel that pulls out to reveal the cotton packed into the hollowed out cavity. It never works reliably the first time its used, and then will burn through all its fuel on the second try, and will burn for 3 hours if fully fueled. The light from the lighter can reveal the presence of Abyssal writing (which is normally invisible).
    The diseased remains of the first king of the land. Died soon after he founded the land, patient zero of a potent plague - High Lord Rolnir's Remains.
    A fairly mundane looking knick-knack like a spinning wheel or a pot or something boring of slight historical significance. It's actually a lich's phylactery.
    A jar of a glue-like oozing substance. When fed bones it will produce a sticky glue, when hungry it turns acidic and vaporous. It can die.
    The claw of the first lycanthrope, preserved in a jar. It's said that a scratch from the preserved claw still harbours a more virulent, primordial strain of the curse. Best it stay in the jar.
    A muzzle, fitted to house four long appendages where a mouth would be on a normal person. There are legends of an ancient race that held the Mind Flayers under their heel, but nowhere else on Earth exists any evidence of such a people, save this.
    A single bottle of pink, fizzy liquid. There is a label affixed to it written in Celestial. It reads "Heaven's Cola" and is sealed with a white cork. A note it attached to it by a thick string and a handwritten note is attached, written in Abyssal, that says, "Happy Birthday Dad".
    A fist-sized gem of a deep red colour. Inside a shadow flicks and twitches like a tadpole in an egg. Rumour has it that this is the seed of a god.
    A pair of gloves that look like bear paws, complete with felt claws. They appear to be quite large, but always change size to fit the wearer perfectly. On full moons, the wearer of the gloves will change into a full-sized brown bear, but will have hands of the wearer. This lasts until sunrise, and will repeat on each night of the full moon. There is a 10% chance that the change is permanent.
    Mimirion- Three oddly shaped seeds, they seem to hate the sun. It grows during the night on moonlight, giving off an odorous scent, before developing a seed again at the end of its life cycle and the morning light.
    A longsword whose blade is split clean in half, with constant searing heat on both edges of the break. The pommel bears the crest of God.
    A tin cup with a bent handle and a dented rim. The base (flipped upside-down) has an inscription written in Common that says "Who Dat Moose?". There is nothing else remarkable about it's appearance. Whomever drinks from the cup, however, will demand to be called "Moose" instead of their real name and will do anything to retain ownership of the cup, including murderous violence.
    A small oil painting of a ferret. To many people it seems completely mundane. Anyone illiterate who views it will see the portrait animate. The ferret inside will speak and insult the onlooker before attempting to teach them how to read.
    A bag of seeds in a burlap sack. There are approximately 500 seeds in the bag. If planted, they will grow into full sized fence posts in approximately six weeks. The posts will never rot and never need painting.
    A young man. No, not a preserved one, a live human male aged about 23. He smells constantly of skunk spray and demands you keep a distance from his display. He is otherwise very inward.
    The Deurggometer - a small black box with an eye-hole in it. "DO NOT LOOK INTO THE BOX" is painted on a sign in big red letters. Inside the box are little clay figures that look like people you know. Ask the person looking into the box to name a failed love. That person is now in the box. Ask them if they like their mother more or their father more. Whichever one they pick is not present. Ask the other player's at the table to place one more person in the box (this can be anyone from the player's life). Then you, as the DM choose one more player at the table to be present in the box. Roll to determine what happens. Mark down each roll so you remember how many times you rolled, and after each roll ask the player if they want to keep looking. Continue to roll until they say they can't watch anymore. For each outcome, roll 2d4 to determine who does what. Then place a verb between them: (Loves, Kisses, Marries, Adventures with, Hides, Dines with, Has Sex with, Bites, Stabs, Betrays, Cries about, Buries, Ostracizes, Eats, Chases, Cleaves, Mocks, Executes, Owns, Comforts.) The number of times you roll equals the amount of days before one of these things comes true.
    A mask of a crow. If worn, the speaker will be attacked by phantom crows until the mask is removed. However, the mask does not want to be removed and will resist by psychically attacking the wearer. If the mask wins the struggle, the wearer will die of his imagined wounds in less than an hour. If the owner wins the struggle, the mask teleports 10-1000 miles in a random direction, but will always end up in a place of civilization, regardless of distance traveled.
    A gold coin minted in some long forgotten time. The face on the coin is of an old man with a short beard and a crown. When flipped the coin always lands heads up.
    A candle that burns in reverse, collecting material from the aether forming it into a water-rich waxy substance that can be eaten. Producing a cup-worth of water takes an hour of burning.
    A pair of sandals that always feel sandy, no matter how often they are washed. The sandals will change shape to fit any sized feet. The benefit of the sandals is the ability to walk on water for up to 1 hour.
    A stuffed skunk the size of a bull. The skunk's black and white fur is reversed, and it has 7 eyes and six legs. The stink gland has been surgically removed, with large unruly stitches in its wake.
    A magical crossbow that is completely ordinary in every regard, except for the fact that whenever the user misses a shot it loudly insults them and their lineage.
    A mockingbird that will appear as a beautiful piece of taxidermy, but will reveal itself to be haunted by the ghost of an angry spirit who mocks the owner relentlessly while in its presence. The mockingbird can never be sold, but can be given away.
    A dull green glass bottle, filled with transparent oil that rolls about like the sea's tides. Its label, written in Undercommon, reads "Immortality." It is sealed with a deep black cork, and if opened reeks of skunk spray.
    "What do you see?" -Whoever looks at this painting will see the room (or place) they grew up in. If you look at it alone, the painting will move and show you a moment from your past. If you crawl into the painting you will inhabit your child body for exactly 10 seconds of real time (long enough to say one thing that you do) before being ejected from the painting.
    A set of 6 jars of preserves in a calico-lined wooden basket. The jam will raise the dead, but requires the owner to give up something precious to them - this includes family members, property, and memories.
