        what kind of cult is this?
            based around a single charismatic individual.
            a mainline faith, pushed to extremes.
            a new faith or mystery, perhaps from a far away land or inspired locally.
            hereditary in nature, passed along family lines or just a single gender.
            keeps to the old one(s).
            a secret society, or another form of cryptic organization.
            decadent and listless, the members of this cult are in it for the thrill.
            a doomsday cult, these folk believe that the world is ending soon, if not any day.
        
        what are they trying to accomplish?
            a genuine exploration of their beliefs and inspirations. note that this could still have negative connotations.
            summoning something, like a(n)...aberration, fiend, people from the past/future/another dimension, celestial.
            upheaval of the status quo or current government.
            engaging in some act unpalatable to the rest of society, like...cannibalism, proscribed sexual acts, excessive drug or alcohol use, fight club.
            the death of some important figure, or more broadly, a faction.
            the destruction of a rival faith, or any other faith.
            support and enrichment of it's members, whether that be through legal or illegal means.
            exploitation of it's members; roll again and ignore this result if rolled again. the second result is what they tell to new recruits.
        
        where is their membership drawn from?
            ne'er do wells; criminals, beggars & transients.
            the elite of society.
            working class folk, the salt of the earth.
            all walks of life
            racially, culturally or ethnically exclusive.
            a certain profession, such as fisher folk, merchants or farmers.
            an isolated or otherwise insular folk.
            those who have been brainwashed, chosen or ensorcelled in some way.

        how do they operate?
            out in the open. they are passive, and unwilling to commit violence - unless their faith requires it.
            openly, with hostility and great abandon.
            clandestinely, with a vicious streak towards any who stumble upon them.
            covertly, those who discover them are met with bribes, cajoling and religious arguments.
            the cult attempts to masquerade as a more pedestrian organization.
            they recruit openly locally, but their true home is somewhere far away and hidden.
            through a cellular structure, each cell is kept ignorant of what the other is doing, but there is a secret architect lurking somewhere.
            coordinated through dreams, they move seemingly without communication.

    treasure
        who hid it? why?
            it was an accident, a shipment lost to random chance or calamity. for some reason it was never reclaimed.
            a noble family, displaced by a revolt or disaster, hid their secret somewhere only they could find it.
            a group of raiders or pirates, storing a score until it was safe to retrieve it.
            members of a religious minority, fleeing persecution.
            an extremely powerful figure, such as a culture hero or particularly skilled spellcaster.
            the treasure was part of a tontine or related to the retirement of the members. everyone died before anyone could retrieve it.
            the society surrounding the hidden treasure collapsed, and its location was forgotten.
            the treasure was important in some way -- perhaps it was the site of votive offerings, or the location of a guild's vault -- and it was guarded. while most of it's sentinels have died or vanished, some may still be guarding it.

        where does it lead to?
            an isolated and deserted island.
            deep inside a cave or another subterranean region.
            a religious site, such as a temple or a shrine.
            the middle of nowhere, a barren place, far from any civilization.
            inside an urban area, currently inhabited or reduced to deserted ruins.
            the bottom of the ocean or a lake.
            a castle in the sky.
            a celestial body, such as a planet or other plane of existence.

        and what's hidden there?
            riches! glittering gold and prizes. the intrepid explorers receive (3d105) gp.

            riches! glittering gold and prizes. the intrepid explorers receive (3d105) gp.
            pandora's lament. an extremely powerful monster has been bound to this site. opening where it is held releases it.
            cache of weapons - 50% chance to be magical, 50% chance to be make of an exotic material such as silver, obsidian or ivory.
            cache of weapons - 50% chance to be magical, 50% chance to be make of an exotic material such as silver, obsidian or ivory.
            cultural artifacts and personal effects. worthless to most, priceless to the right buyers.
            magical paraphernalia such as scrolls and potions, maybe even a spellbook.
        
        what form does the map take?
            the classic treasure map. made of vellum, inked, and showing off a simple guide to the terrain leading to and around the score. 50% chance that the map is in multiple parts
            the map is relatively well-known regionally and it takes the form of a local legend such as a story, poem or song.
            a strange and bizarre device, such as a potion which makes one recall the memories of one of the people who hid it.
            a cipher, puzzle or some other form of riddle.
            the map is hidden within the patterns of a natural feature, such as a set of holes within a hillside, or the shadows of a grove of trees.
            one of the people (or a descendant of one) responsible for hiding the treasure is spilling the location to people. the party are certainly not the only ones who have caught wind of it.
            the map is split between a number of people, no more than a half-dozen, all of whom have a piece of it.
            there is no map - there are only the remaining notes (and possibly spirits) of those who hid it. they must be searched or interrogated for the location.
    disaster
        what caused this?
            random accident has conspired against the community. no one in particular is responsible.

            random accident has conspired against the community. no one in particular is responsible.
            random accident has conspired against the community. no one in particular is responsible.
            the gods themselves have been offended. a sacrifice was not made, a sacred animal or a priest was murdered, or someone has committed some other terrible transgression. further recompense may be necessary.
            a dark ritual or curse is targeting the community. the calamity may the goal or merely a side-effect. this may only be a prelude.
            a prophecy has come to pass. it was written in the ancient scrolls, and you were fools to have ignored them.
            this is a knock-on effect, of another disaster. roll again, adding another catastrophe on top of the first.
        
        what kind of catastrophe is it?
            an invasion, whether in the form of bandits, a foreign foe or even something as pedestrian as locusts or weevils.
            plague, deadly enough that healing magic has no means to arrest it.
            a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami or volcanic eruption.
            climate related disaster, such as an unusually long and intense rainy season, or a parching drought.
            a weather related event, such as a tornado, hurricane or wild fire.
            an explicitly magical event, such as a sourceless tune which forces listeners to dance or the dead beginning to rise from their graves.
            blight and pestilence. it leads to the the death of any crops and livestock which are afflicted.
            a bizarre and fortean event, such as a rain of frogs or the waters within a river or lake turning to blood.
        
        what is the scale of the devastation?
            only a few families, or perhaps a couple of buildings.
            the equivalent of a small town or village.
            the equivalent of a small town or village.
            a city, or several villages or towns.
            a city, or several villages or towns.
            an entire region or province.
            an entire region or province.
            the entirety of a country, empire or kingdom.
        
        how is the community dealing with this?
            nonchalance. this event is a regular occurrence, to the point where most folk pay it no mind.
            a doomsayer has appeared, promising to solve what vexes the community if they merely commit a few unspeakable acts. people are listening.
            mild panic. there are runs on stores, hoarding and small bouts of interpersonal violence, but no breakdown in law and order.
            mild panic. there are runs on stores, hoarding and small bouts of interpersonal violence, but no breakdown in law and order.
            severe panic. looting, burning, combat in the streets.
            open revolution. the followers are blaming the leaders, and are planning on holding them responsible through violent means.
            mass exodus. everyone flees the area as fear seizes them.
            resignation and apathy have overtaken them. the disaster seems inevitable, so they no longer see the point in struggling.
    mercenary/ military
        what kind of warriors are these?
            light infantry, trained to do battle loose-order and to fight as raiders, scouts and skirmishers. they are equipped with a mix of ranged and melee weapons.
            heavy infantry, troops meant to fight in pitched battle and in line, these folk are equipped with the heaviest weapons and armor that they can afford.
            light cavalry possessed of fleets mounts and raged weapons. these troops are talented marauders and scouts and will eagerly run down any retreating enemies.
            heavy cavalry, meant to shatter the enemy with brutal charges. these mounted warriors are heavily armed and armored, with mounts large and powerful enough to carry them.
            a siege train, which includes transports, specialists and ammunition. these could take the form of cannon, rams, sappers or even stranger things.
            ranged troops, whether they are equipped with bows, crossbows or firearms, these soldiers will do their best to stay far away from the enemy and pepper them with missiles.
            privateers, using whatever kind of vessel is appropriate for the setting. most commonly this means a sea-going ship, but this could also mean a river vessel or even something more exotic like an airship.
            a mixed force, roll twice on this table (ignoring this result if it comes up again) to determine what kind of soldiers make up this varied unit.
        
        how numerous are they?
            a small handful, perhaps just a dozen
            several squads, comprising a couple of units and several dozen troops.
            a company, including several officers, which number a little over a hundred in total.
            a cohort, hundreds of battle-ready soldiers and their attendant camp followers.
            a cohort, hundreds of battle-ready soldiers and their attendant camp followers.
            a brigade or legion, several thousand soldiers, along with their support staff, commanders and wagon train.
            a brigade or legion, several thousand soldiers, along with their support staff, commanders and wagon train.
            a veritable army, comprising ~20-30,000 soldiers, along with command staff and various support troops.

        who leads them?
            a noble, fallen from glory and perhaps even exiled from the land of their birth. their leader is likely skilled at both battle and diplomacy, but they are consumed by bitterness from their state and will likely do nearly anything to rectify it.
            these troops mutinied against their officers, and are commanded by the former ringleaders. the ringleaders have grouped themselves into a council, and will vote on important decisions. discipline and uniformity is likely lax.
            a soldier's soldier, someone who has fought their way through countless campaigns and has risen to a position of command. they are likely skilled in the arts of war and death, but lack tact.
            a member of the nobility in good standing. their troops are likely drawn from lands the noble's family controls. the noble isn't likely a mere adventurer, they are looking to advantage their family or themselves.
            these are mercenaries in name only, they are barely better than bandits in behavior and their leader is no exception. likely a vicious killer themselves, the commander of this band keeps control through violence and bribery.
            founded as a money-making endeavor, the commander of this group is more akin to a merchant than a warrior. the leader is likely skilled at negotiating contracts and sniffing out profitable battles.
            led by a devout worshipper of a deity, the troops have been enticed or forced into the worship of their commander's god. whether or not their devotion is true, their leader's is, and they will use the miracles granted by their deity to help them in battle.
            a spellcaster, known for their strange and often baffling ways, leads this group by dint of their abilities. they will aid their folk with spells and mystical knowledge.

        how skilled are they? are they loyal?
            rabble, hardly a cut above levies. they are cowards, who will run if the battle goes against them (-2 to all morale checks), they are however extremely cheap (-40% to costs)
            decently trained and equipped, but they lack motivation (-1 to all morale checks) and they have little care towards their own reputations. they will betray their employer if given a better offer.
            average pay for average skill. they have been trained to acceptable standards, but are nothing special beyond having a reputation for loyalty.
            average pay for average skill. they have been trained to acceptable standards, but are nothing special beyond having a reputation for loyalty.
            average pay for average skill. they have been trained to acceptable standards, but are nothing special beyond having a reputation for loyalty.
            well drilled and disciplined (+1 to all morale checks) troops with an iron-shod reputation.
            the elite, the cream of the crop (+2 to all morale checks, +1 all attack rolls). they are brave and unshakably loyal, but they are hideously expensive (+40% to costs)
            elite (+2 to all morale checks, +1 all attack rolls) soldiers who know all too well their own worth. they cost more (+20% to costs) but that coin does not win their loyalty. they fight for whoever pays them most, even switching sides in the midst of battle.
