            'A large family of gnomes. They are quite welcoming to guests, and serve dishes upon dishes of rich, steaming food at their meals, often accompanied by the father and the older sons singing.', 'A young tiefling loner who’s willing to share his small, spartan flat. A starving-artist type (well, not quite starving, he does pretty well) who specializes in portraits. He doesn’t bother the guests if they don’t bother him. Keeps his work depicting who he remembers as his mother (an Erinyes) in a safe in his room.', 'A soft-spoken Half-orc librarian and his wife, an Elvish herbalist. She isn’t as welcoming as him, but is alright with guests as long as they stay out of the workshop. They both do some of the cooking, so the meals are…unique.', "A Kobold matriarch. While her children have all moved out, their children are dropped off at Grandma’s house quite frequently, and she teaches them all she knows. She also runs a small shrine to Bahamut in the cellar.", "A hot-headed, wealthy heiress and her more rational lady-in-waiting.", "The prince of a corroding noble line, of late taken to dressing in black, composing gloomy poems, and brooding on the battlements of his manor.", "A dwarvish professor with a magnificent walrus mustache, as well as his warm, old-fashioned wife (a dressmaker) and their daughter, who’s visiting for a month or so from her apprenticeship.", "The quiet Mother of a hostel run by the temple of the god of the poor. The tragedy and despair of many of her visitors has rubbed off on her a little. The food is outstanding.", "A not-quite-right young man with ambitions to become a psychologist. Asks far too many personal questions, then goes off on rants about what he thinks shaped his guests to the people they are today. Total quack psychologist, doesn’t know what he’s saying at all.", "An Eladrin who’s spending a few centuries ‘indulging in kindness’. There’s a too-good-to-be-true air to the stay. Breakfast in bed, indoor training arena, a small dungeon built underneath the manor and stocked with inexpensive monsters, a wizard’s study, everything they could possibly want. And the host is always smiling.",
            "A jovial Goliath with an Australian accent who spends most of his time wrestling with various dangerous forms of wildlife. Owns a large merchant company, spends most of his time doing push-ups or lifting weights or wrestling yetis.", "A shriveled, wrinkled, hobbling old Bullywug whose sentences are out of order, and seems to speak in riddles. He wears a slightly threadbare robe and carries a walking stick.", "A stern Halfing dance instructor. She’s quite sprightly, humming waltz tunes as she works. She corrects people’s postures out of force of habit.", "An old Dragonborn mercenary who frequently lapses into a thousand-yard-stare. While not tormented by nightmares, he’s a good-humored guy with quite a few tips on adventuring.", "A water genasi weaver whose skill isn’t quite unmatched, but it’s up there. Naturally, the curtains and carpets of his house are expertly made and quite flamboyant.", "A cackling, bitter old woman. Actually a Green Hag, and her curse is the reason the couple next door (whom she finds insufferable) have been trying for a child for years without success. Serves stew or porridge for every meal from a huge, battered-looking black cauldron.", "A hard-as-nails half-elf rancher. Owns stables upon stables of pure-bred racing horses. Despises city-slickers.", "An old Minotaur noble. He wears huge suits, custom-made for him, and has a staff of Animated Objects who sing, dance, and make dinner.", "A slightly suspicious young woman. Knows far too much about weapons, disappears for long periods of time, and locks the basement door very heavily. She’s an assassin for a local gang of racketeers, and will skip town if she’s found out.", "An Animated Armor that speaks like the Discworld golems (That Is, She Talks Like This) and moves very jerkily. She (well, it’s built for a female humanoid) used to work for an evil artificer before a band of adventurers gave her full free will. Knows a thing or sixty-four about dungeoneering, and considers herself indebted to all adventurers.", "A goblin horse-jockey who loves nothing more than the thrill of a race. Talks a mile a minute, usually boasting about his races, and his house is full of trophies that he polishes devoutly.", "A human card-sharp who won his entire house in a game of Triple Ogres. He’s married to the shrewd but not very welcoming owner of a local tavern. She brings home the latest gossip each night.", "A kobold artificer who’s trying to turn his species’ natural affinity for mechanisms to the good. Owns all sorts of fascinating contraptions, like an automatic pencil-sharpener or a tiny construct that writes down any good ideas he has mid-conversation.", "A merry old smuggler, although he’s put his pirating days behind him aside from the odd chorus of Dead Man’s Chest. His house is adorned with model ships and sketches of exotic shores. Drinks strong home-brewed grog.", "The town doctor. There’s something odd about her of late. She stays up past midnight, tends to skip meals, and always seems to be tearing up some piece of paper and tossing it in the trash. (She’s smitten with the blacksmith’s apprentice, but can’t bring herself to tell him.)", "A rough-and-ready frontier-dwelling female Dwarf, who lives in a quaint cottage. She’s older than most of the village, and knows all the skills of the hinterlands: medicine, hunting, cooking, the lot.", "An old man who can’t seem to look you in the eye. He has one craft, and one craft only: he’s a knife maker. Assassins from every syndicate, court or gang come to him for their daggers. Even the odd Drow comes in the dead of the night to buy an honest-to-Lolth Master Work dagger.", "A scheming duke who tries to see if the party thinks his power-plays would work without hinting too obviously at his massive ambitions.", "A satyr couple who are, well, typical satyrs. They love wine, music, food, the usual revel stuff. Enjoy having guests, of course, but can’t stand ‘sticks in the mud’, ‘killjoys’ or ‘introverts’.", "A female Drow who left the Underdark because she’s claustrophobic. Polite, in a regal sort of way. Her house doesn’t have hallways so much as long, broad halls, with bookcases or coffee tables or armchairs.", "A newer vampire who is having a little bit of an identity crisis. He gets the ‘nocturnal’ part, yes, he gets that, but isn’t the whole ‘domination’ thing a little unethical? and similar conversation. Keeps forgetting that garlic tastes disgusting to him now.", "The best Dwarvish pastry-chef that has ever walked the earth. And she knows it. Quite boastful.", "The keeper of a local shrine to the fire god. He’ll just sit by the fireplace, staring into it for hours on end. Has a very large and overly friendly golden retriever.", "The local ‘crazy cat lady’. An Air Genasi whose hair is always blowing in a gentle breeze. This confuses her cats to no end. She has forty-three of them, and one Mimic who enjoys it’s current lifestyle and has decided to stay shaped like a cat.", "A Tabaxi game-warden. His wolfhound isn’t part wolf, it’s part Displacer Beast, which means people often think he has two dogs. Pleasant but fairly quiet.", "A grizzled old human war veteran. Wears an eyepatch. Has a suit of plate-armor stained with horrific, otherworldly humors in his front hall. Retired after ridding his ancestral estate of some kind of great beast he refuses to describe.", "A gnomish scientist who studies modrons. He’s utterly fascinated by them, and can go on for hours with horrifically dull facts and factoids about them. His house is littered with mounted modrons, dissected modrons, everything modron-related you could imagine.", "A time-wizard who messes with his personal time for kicks. Making himself twelve years old, being in four places at once. He thinks it’s a riot. His house is full of books of temporal magic, or at least it was, twelve minutes before you try to open one of them. Opening one book makes them all vanish to the past. It’s his security system.", "A noble Knight Lord who lives in a small castle and commands an order of chivalrous Knights. A former adventurer.", "A wise Grand Wizard who lives in a magic tower and commands a guild of powerful Wizards. A former adventurer.", "A clever Spymaster who lives in a heavily-secured manor and commands a guild of Spies. A former adventurer.", "A pious High Priest of Light who lives in a modest house attached to a glorious Temple. A former adventurer.", "A homely man with balding white hair, a small beard and eyeglasses. Meets with friends often, talking for hours in the cellar. Are they…acting? Playing some sort of dice-game? It’s not quite clear. Says he hails from the realm of Greyhawk.", "An elvish professor of languages who, despite having fought in several wars, is a honorable, straight-laced, old-fashioned gentleman. He’s writing a rather long book. Apparently it’s about halflings and some kind of Ring?", "A razor-witted Dwarvish comedian who does standup at local taverns, dishing out the side-clutchers and knee-slappers galore. Willing to share a few jokes with the party, too. His ‘why did the cockatrice cross the road?’ always gets ’em.", "A Bugbear leg-breaker for the local mob is trying way too hard to be polite and gracious. His apartment’s nice, of course, but he seems to think that the entire party are some sort of sting operation.", "A former Underdark delver, this calm but dispassionate female Tiefling is married to a far more bubbly and cheery Wood Elf. They bicker regularly about what ‘acceptable decorations’ are, stuffed Troglodyte heads or singing roses.", "A brawny whiskey-maker who meets over a nice, old keg with rogues and grave-robbers every night, it seems. His house is above his tavern.", "An Eladrin woodcarver who has recently taken up trying to enchant things. She’s terribly confident it’ll work out eventually, but for now you’ll have to put up with wooden busts that hurl abuse or curse words and cutlery that work together to spell out rather rude slang.", "A Halfling balloonist with a terrible case of wanderlust. Half of his things haven’t been unpacked yet, half of them are already ready to go.", "A master wizard who crafts Golems. Has some shady deals with dungeon overlords, but is still a good man. Might cut the Evil Overlords off from his business if approached; he’s a man of principles, just needs a push of sorts to get him to stand his ground for them.", "An Aasimar teamster who’s moving into the song business. He’s got quite the voice, and a few songs already written: All Shook Up, 500 Miles, and he’s working on a few more.", "A slightly edgy Tiefling who wants to be both friendly and intimidating. Budding metalhead. His apartment is nearly plastered with band posters and song lyrics.", "A genteel, aristocratic Red Dragon who lives in an enormous castle.", "A curious young man enamored by the sea. Despite his youth, his hair is receding. He never seems to blink, either. His house is full of weird idols and jewelry of ancient civilizations.", "A charlatan ‘wizard’ who’s really just a chemist. Tries to keep her lab hidden. Nearly has a breakdown if she’s confronted about her fraud.", "A Goliath strongman of the local circus. His quarters are rather large, because he’s rather large. They’re right next to the acrobats’ and the lion tamer’s.", "A vain elvish wizard who spends most of her time in front of her magic mirror, and the rest of it complaining about upload schedules and dislike mobs and ad revenue.", "A dwarvish butcher. His wife is an author. Both of his daughters are in preschool. He himself is vegetarian, but does eat fish. Spends his evenings playing pool in the cellar with his friends, or going on walks with his daughters.", "A professional court-jester of the local duke or lord. Not as cheery off the job; gripes to anyone who’ll listen about his poor wages and difficult job. His house is a small cottage within the bailey of the castle.", "A tight-lipped priest who seems to have a shrine to every god in his tiny house. The hallways are crammed with altars and icons, and the whole place smells like incense 24/7.", "An unintentionally insufferable Aasimar ballerina. Lets the guests have the run of the kitchen; she’s too busy practicing for her next performance in the studio downstairs.", "A young bachelor Mountain Dwarf, who’s bitter about getting turned down by the local army or militia. He’s drinking a little more than is good for him.", "A gnomish jeweler, his wife and three children. They have a pretty large townhouse. The husband is a little busy with an important order: a new crown for an anonymous nobleman.", "A halfling priest of various gods of knowledge and nature. He’s a part-time biologist, running a few experiments in the lab in his basement. He’d love to meet a Druid or Ranger with more hands-on experience than himself.", "A Fey who lives in a checkers-themed tower. May kick the guests out if they mention chess or use chess analogies. Most of the food is circular (pie, pancakes, etc.), the tablecloths and bedsheets all have checkered patterns. Writes long letters to a bitter rival.", "A Fey who lives in a chess-themed tower. Gets rather testy if people mention checkers. The staff are construct automatons that only move like particular chess pieces. Complains about a completely irrational rival who sends him storms of nonsense letters every day.", "A professional human trick-shot-archer. She goes on tour with the circus now and then. Her favorite one is nailing a playing card out of someone’s hand from one hundred paces.", "A stout Dwarf who’s a master cook. He puts his heart and soul into every slab of beef, taking hours just to prepare them for barbecuing. Doesn’t spend much time with the guests.", "A human former doctor (she’s still got the beak-mask hung up on the wall in an airtight case, and she warns the party that it’s quite contaminated) who retired after fighting some sort of otherworldly entity beneath her ancestral estate. Recently took up horse-riding.", "A human comedian whose jokes tend to be at his own expense. Unmarried but pretty well-off, for a comedian. He tends to leave in the evening and come back close to midnight after his show.", "An eladrin priest of Tymora. Closer to his fey ancestry than most Eladrin. He’s scheming with a local gang to spring some of their hooligans from prison- after all, the whims of chance are unpredictable, or so he’ll say if the party threatens to inform the authorities. Then he will try and bribe them.", "A calm Oriental-looking man who works as a janitor during the day. His apartment isn’t exactly barren, but it’s certainly unextravagant. He’s teaching a local child the various martial arts he mastered in his time as a Monk.", "A simple Halfling herb-farmer. She has a small plot of land behind her house, where she grows things like spices and vegetables. Patient, because as she says, you can’t hurry peppers. Spends most of her time reading novels.", "A dragonborn tale-weaver. No, not an author, she’s quite firm. A tale-weaver, the kind that don’t get written down so much as passed along. Though she doesn’t exactly have it in writing, she’s very familiar with the wording and themes that make a riveting tale.", "A solemn, gods-fearing Dwarvish carpenter. They call him the Pious Benchmaker, which baffles him. His wife is of somewhat better cheer, but tolerates no nonsense in her house. The furniture is first-rate. You could hit it with a battle-hammer and it wouldn’t dent.", "An Aasimar mattress-maker. Laments his own misfortune: his mattresses are so good, he either sleeps on them and can’t get himself out of bed, or he sleeps on a couch or armchair and doesn’t sleep well. It’s a DC X Strength save to get off his guest-beds (the best ones, for he’s quite hospitable), where X is 10 plus the number of days since the sleeper has been in a normal bed instead of a bedroll or cot.", "A slightly unhinged half-orc scholar. He’s studying all sorts of bizarre phenomena at once, and keeps a wall covered in notes, sketches, and pieces of twine connecting them. The statistical anomalies of coin flips, the way the planet is tilted, all those sorts of things. Frequently becomes so engrossed in his studies he forgets to eat.", "A ratcatcher who is quite ferocious in his task. He’s got mousetraps all over the place, and hundreds of rat skulls nailed to his wall. Grim, adamant, and talks at length about what utter vermin rodents are.", "A friendly, jocular doppelganger illusionist and it’s tame mimic pets. The house appears to have a large staff of servants and much finely-made furniture…", "A gnomish Expert Clown. He doesn’t just study mere tossing and tumbling, mind you. He studies the psychology of clowning. What makes a pie to the face so funny? Or what is the thrill-inducing factor of juggling eggs? He can tell you. He can tell you for several hours.", "A human stone-carver and his teenage son. The son’s a little worried about his father, as the latter seems to be losing interest in the craft. Their house is full of half-finished works.", "A high elf mask-maker. It’s a delicate craft, she’ll tell you. Fey come to call every so often, picking up their masks but also staying to chat with her a bit. So do some actors. And one or two assassins.", "A scruffy human gravedigger. He isn’t exactly a philosopher, but tends to make incisive remarks about mortality and time. Doesn’t like elves, because they don’t give him business.", "An old man with a bald head and gleaming eyes. If asked, he only gives his profession as ‘chemist’, and spends a lot of time in his lab. He’s less harmless than he seems; he’s the master poison-brewer for a local assassin’s guild. If he’s found out, he calls in his allies on whoever discovered his true identity.", "A young couple of a Tiefling and an Aasimar. Their ancestors didn’t like the marriage much, and it couldn’t exactly get officiated by a priest (but the local marriage law did allow for a Fey to do the job). They’re getting along fine.", "A pious couple who are gravely concerned about their young daughter. She claims to see ‘shadowy people’ in the cellar, and apparently brought the family dog back to life. They’re both nearly nervous wrecks, and priests of every Good god have been coming and going all week to try and exorcise the child.", "A white-haired old man and his shrill wife, both the village healers, although the Mr. recently got fired by the prince whose father he used to work for.", "A playwright who is outraged at his rivals trying to spread the rumor that his work was ghostwritten for him. Insists on reading off sonnets and scenes to the guests to prove that he’s genuine.", "A grizzled, scarred town guard. He’s only in during the day, usually asleep, and spends the nights walking the streets and smoking very particular cheap cigars. Moody but not hostile.", "A ‘professional quest-giver’ who pampers the heroes with everything he can. He’s in kahoots with a local dungeon-lord, and gets a share of the armor, weapons and loot of the heroes killed in the dungeon he directs them towards. He’ll take to the hills if he’s found out.", "A young priestess of a god of the wilds. Her house is on the very outskirts of town, and has a terrible case of rats, which she doesn’t mind as long as they don’t bother the guests. Rats that do bother the guests get speared. She doesn’t take nonsense, but has some sense of humor.", "A Kenku minstrel who rents a room above the tavern he performs in. It’s covered in posters from his ‘glory-days’- although a keen eye (DC 15 Investigation) will note that they’re actually other bards’ posters, with the minstrel’s name altered into them.", "An apprentice baker and his wife, a schoolteacher. Their house was a cheap deal, and is a little run-down but still serviceable. Gets a little drafty, though.", "A Kobold who claims to be an architect and interior designer. Actually, she’s a dungeon planner who designs catacombs, lairs and castles galore. Highly sought-after by evil overlords, and frantically tries to direct them away while the guests are there. If she’s found out, she’ll flee to the safety of one of her closer creations.", "A Swordsmith who has been at it for years. He keeps a display case of splintered, shattered or blunted swords recovered from various dungeons and battlefields, each with the tale of a fallen hero attached to it.", "A halfling gourmand with an affinity for candies. He’s a longstanding foe of witches who use his creations, or mockeries thereof, to lure children into their cook-pots.", "A Dwarvish family of four- father, mother, son, daughter -who are rather new in town. Hospitable, but the house is still full of moving crates. The father is a lumberjack, the mother is a stay-at-home parent.", "The High Priest of a local shrine of the god of travelers and messengers. He’s an unmatched source of information, references and road maps, and will greet anybody with a smile so long as they return the favor.", "An old Elvish couple. The husband spends most of his time golfing or whittling, the wife is busy giving advice to her newly-married daughter. They live in a nice old house, although there’s a ghost in the attic. Don’t worry, it’s very polite during the day, and it can’t leave the attic.",

Pulling the lever surprisingly opens the door. If you touch the door without pulling the lever, the trap door opens.", "A series of regal-looking interconnected hallways are dimly lit with magical torches suspended in sconces. The entrance that the intruders come through suddenly closes itself off, and the intruders sit in silence for a few seconds. Looking down one of the other hallways reveals a slowly encroaching patch of darkness that snuffs out the torches as it makes its way forward, which relight themselves when intruders approach them while the darkness is not nearby. The intruders must search the various corridors while simultaneously avoiding the patch of darkness, which envelops and leaves no trace of anything that enters it. Any attempts to do combat with the darkness prove ineffectual, as anything that enters vanishes, never to be seen again. The darkness is semi-sentient, and the intruders can interact with it by trying to hide from it or get it to follow them. The key to escaping the hallways lies with the magic torches in the two impressively decorated sconces that the darkness can’t seem to pass by. By removing one of the special torches and carrying it with them, an intruder can hold off the darkness or even push it back. However, confronting it for too long will begin to dim the torch until it eventually snuffs out, forcing the holder to escape the darkness in order for the torch to relight. When the special torches approach the darkness from both sides of a hallway, it condenses and eventually fades, leaving a shadowy door to the outside where the last of it vanished.", "A roughly cut gemstone hovers ominously over a crude alter in a cavernlike room while a malicious spirit floats up around the ceiling and out of sight. New entities entering the room causes the crystal turn to face the intruders, revealing that it is actually an eye of some sort, containing a pupil that darts rapidly between the intruders and the spirit. The spirit immediately begins cajoling the crystal eye into destroying the intruders, talking to it as though it were a child in need of guidance. After a few seconds of apparent listening, the eye completely focuses on the spirit and pillars of rock begin to rapidly erupt from the room’s surfaces at points near the intruders. The pillars, while initially inaccurate, begin homing in on the intruders more and more the longer they stay still, and do 5d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit. The key to escaping the room is the crystal eye in the center of the room, which is being told by the spirit to kill the intruders. By being more persuasive than the spirit, intruders can convince the eye to stop its onslaught and eventually target the spirit instead, which will disperse after being hit multiple times with pillars of rock. The eye is very childlike in its considerations and will lose focus if the intruders fail to convince it or begin to act too impatient. Simplistic approaches work well, and the eye responds positively to constructive encouragement when it targets the intruders (That was some very good aiming, I could feel the wind rush by me! Next time though, try to aim towards the mean spirit instead, OK?). Once the spirit is destroyed, a gentle suggestion that the eye create an exit will convince it to pull a slab of rock away from a wall and reveal a passage to outside the room.", "Walking through an area with “Dormant hives of bees,” there is a queen bee figurine with a stinger shaped like a key in a glass jar at the opening of a room.

Once the next hallway both statues have hands that turn, and one activates the traps just cleared while the other deactivates the ones ahead (but both can’t happen so if the try to deactivate the traps ahead it will still be active). And finally the last hallway will deactivate the traps but the floor is pressure sensitive. Illustrate this by having the party see the hand start to turn back when a member starts to walk across. Essentially the first two hallways punish groups that don’t follow right behind the rogue and send him forward to handle traps, while the last hallway punishes players who just follow right behind the rogue, and are afraid to make any distance.", "A map is found on a skeleton wrapped around an old skeleton key.

The ambush comes and there are kobolds on the lower level trying to reach the member while the party is ambushed and distracted. They will have to decide who is saving their friend and who is fighting, while the member is dangling and until he gets himself right side up is at a disadvantage to all attacks.

It would probably take about an hour to do so from room temperature, but you can. More importantly, if you keep your gold coins at a hot enough temperature, they’ll melt very quickly if exposed to a very potent heat source – like say they might melt within seconds if they were doused in lamp oil and lit. This is an interesting thing to note if your chosen method of storing gold coins is in a wire-mesh cage attached to the ceiling. Especially if such a cage is kept at very high temperature, and is trapped with various kinds of flame traps (flame traps that trigger onto the gold). Unfortunately, while the temperature might be relatively high compared to the meltin point of most metal, it’s still more than enough to cook any flesh it comes in contact with (and STICK to that flesh, as molten metal tends to, causing the WORST sort of burns). And of course, the easiest way to get at the gold itself is from directly below it. Be sure to note to the party how hot it is in the room with the gold while they’re standing under it. If they’re clever enough to figure out the trap beforehand, hopefully they’re also clever enough to notice the hidden drains in the floor before all that molten gold runs (very, very quickly) down those drains.", "At the end of a hallway is a fake door. When the doorknob is turned, a latch is released, and the spring mounted door flies out at whoever opened the door. Since the door takes up most of the hallway, there is no chance to dodge it at all.

The pit is 25 feet deep.", "The character steps into the trap and the gem eyes from a roomful of statues shoots rays at him. The PC is zapped and appears to be disintegrated. A skeleton appears in his place. It’s important that the PC’s don’t get a chance to detect this trap or they’ll quickly find a solution (Search DC30). The character is teleported to a sealed tomb filled with the skeletons of various victims. A black pudding, CR equal to the party, attempts to engulf the teleported PC and turn him into a skeleton with its acid. When the trap goes off, one of these skeletons is instantly teleported to where the PC was standing, making it appear like he was disintegrated. Make a Search DC 25 to notice the skeleton (pile of bones) is not the same makeup as the PC (DC 20 if the size category of the PC is one larger or smaller than medium). After six teleportations, the “living” victims (or their remains) are teleported back to the trap area. Defeat the trap by moving statues into the area so they can be teleported, eventually sending out “victims.”", "A room of freezing ice orbs that stick to the skin and slow the characters down significantly. Add monsters/other challenges to taste.", "A long passage of murky, depthless water. Two boats are tied up at the entrance- one that looks rickety and has a little water in the bottom, and one that is new looking, gilded on the edges and looks really watertight.

Occasionally have a player step on a block that depresses a little, and tell them a puff of air just shot out of the block on the wall to their immediate left or right.", "A seemingly wooden door that says “Knock”. Knock on the door to enter. ALTERNATIVELY: a seemingly wooden door, badly worn; it seems as if it could just be destroyed. Players can see the other side, in fact. Catch? Nobody but the weakest among any group that approaches it, can open it. It cannot be destroyed by anything.", "A badly written sign in [the language of whatever people made the dungeon] that says “beware”; the area is somewhat stinky. It leads to a small hallway with another likewise-made/written sign that says “turn back”. It’s getting smellier now, and much more damp. If the party continues, they find themselves at the bottom of the underground shithouse. Bonus: if they made it this far, and if they get clever and can’t smell anything and want to risk being a social pariah for the next several days, they can climb the spout to the room(s) connected, above.", "Magic runes that activate when a character steps into and area, casting floor of ice. To move characters must roll dexterity or fall probe and take damage.", "While travelling along a path towards a popular location or city, the PCs hear a voice so soothing and enchanting that they are compelled to move towards it. On failing a DC 15 Wisdom check, they walk towards the voice which leads to a hag nest. The voice emanates from one of the hags. On a successful check, PCs can still hear the voice but are able to clear their minds long enough to break free from the hold of the song. Lots of footprints are seen going in that direction.", "A flameskull is slightly buried underneath some dirt. The soil around it has been disturbed. As a player (or two) steps closer, they fall through the soil into the gelatinous cube below, and the flameskull rises striaight into the air.", "While travelling to a popular location or city on a path that is obscured (such as forest or cave), the party hears cries of help from a woman. These cries emanate from a hidden kenku group that ambush the party when they approach the voice.", "A stone bridge over a section of an otherwise normal river, the “water” under which is actually a grouping of gelatinous cubes in wait to surround any passers, running water hiding their already transparent bodies.", "A literal CATapult, triggered by a wire. If activated, a Cat is flung at the PC who triggered the trap. This cat will get an attack of opportunity with its claws while being flung, and will enter combat with the party afterwards.", "A ceiling trapdoor opens letting out a swarm of poisonous snakes as well as a giant poisonous snake.", "Three chests sit in a room.

He’s not hostile and is pinned in place by the surrounding walls as he was chasing dinner down a hole and has wiggled himself into this tunnel, blocking any forward movement. If the party attacks him, he will yell and cry, ‘Stop it, please!’ and be overly pathetic, but with his arms pinned at his sides, they will likely kill him in time (suggest higher hit points than normal so the party has to take their time). If they chat with him, he knows a bit about the surrounding rooms as he’s seen creatures moving through the halls and possibly former adventurers. His name is Gordum, and he’s really hungry as he hasn’t eaten in a very long time. Normally, adventurers take pity on him and feed him while they make their way through the dungeon, but the real reason he stays stuck here is a ring of sustenance that he found years ago and pull on ’cause it was shiny.’ If he’s friendly, he offers to watch over the party while they sleep and promises to warn them if anyone else comes down the hallway.", "A rune trap curses you so that you can’t refuse a request.

The water is chilled and safe, even if it tastes earthy and heavy with minerals. As the group moves into the cave, they likely notice coins littering the edges of the room in small piles and an outcropping halfway up on the east wall… with a snoring, smoking dragon’s head. If the party is quiet, they can sneak through, but any attacks or loud noise wake and do not harm the dragon. It lets out a massive burst of fire over the heads of the group and yells curses as it waves around. Once it finishes, it demands tribute from the group or it will eat them!! In reality, the head and neck are a permanent illusion that was placed in the area to scare off adventurers by a mage who was practicing some new defenses for his study, and a fairy dragon has worked out how to control the illusion and get it to move when he wants. He uses magic to project his voice and sound like a great dragon, and can use a rune placed as part of the illusion to fire a cone of fire 3 times a day that does damage as an ancient dragon.

Like creepy stalagmites, hundreds of humanoid statues point up from the ground. One looks like a prince leaning in to kiss a sleeping princess, another is a goblin throwing its hands in the air in panic, and another a cautious knight stalking in his armor.

This is a village of Myconids that have lived here peacefully ‘since the time of our first spores’ and numbers in the thousands. They beg the party to help them as there is a murdered in the midst. Every day, more and more of their people go missing, and they can’t find the culprit. If they are helped, they will give the party pearls that they collect from nearby shellfish and have saved for years.

He REALLY loves cooked mushrooms and has been harvesting the myconids for dinner since finding the village).", "Welcome Matt – The group comes to a door rigged with a number of traps. A line at the top that pulls something above the door if it’s opened, a pressure plate that’s released from the bottom if the door is opened, poison darts that fire from the wall behind it, the works! All the traps are fairly easy to spot and disarm, and there are 6 total. An exceeding high perception check is needed to hear that there’s a small click after each trap is set off or disarmed. Once all six have been triggered, the real trap occurs. The walls 30 feet to either side of the door slam into the ceiling (these are 10ft cubes). At the same time, the floor drops out under the door at a steep angle to a smooth shoot, and the walls start moving in. While it looked like there was something behind the door, it leads no where but a series of mirrors that look like a nearly endless hallway, and with the walls closing in, the only way is down. Those characters that do slide down are eventually deposited into a large cage where a robed figure covered in bandages whips around and screams, ‘Happy Birthday Matt!’ He’s then disappointed that you and yours are not Matt. After muttering to himself for a while, he eventually apologizes for the ‘trap’ and releases the group, showing them to a set of stairs that head back to the tunnel.

You can’t sell the ring. Putting the ring on the man’s finger will restore him from stone, at which point he reveals this ring was the result of a transmutation spell going horribly wrong. He gives you a level appropriate large sum of gold for releasing him and goes off on his merry way.", "The ceiling of the dungeon tunnel has partially collapsed down, making it very difficult to get past. Characters would have to strip off any medium or heavier armor and backpacks to crawl past it. Investigating it more reveals some furniture at the top of the rubble near the ceiling, indicating a room above, but investigating it will probably complete the collapse and prevent further exploration down the tunnel.", "A several story deep library attended to by a seemingly human librarian that doesn’t know his library is deep in an underground dungeon. The stacks are littered with skeletons of all shapes and sizes but it doesn’t seem to bother the attendant. Now that you mention it, it has been a few years since he’s had anyone visit. That is, of course, anyone besides the necromancer that comes by every so often. – defeating the necromancer and his skeletons allows you access to the library. It contains a bunch of spell books for the wizards in your party, some defensive magical items, a moderate stash of gold, and a heap of baubles and nearly insignificant magical items.", "An undead, but coherrent, merchant runs a small item shop in the depths of the dungeon. The shopkeep is a little mad, but seems content to run a shop with average or slightly below average prices on basic goods (maybe a few rarities at DM’s discretion.) The Merchant seems disinterested in the world beyond the room their shop is located in, and if pressed seems to think they’re getting new supplies in once a week. Will react accordingly if the PCs attempt to cheat or steal from them.", "An archway has been heavily barricaded and the area around it has sign postings in the language of the dungeon’s inhabitants with stern warning to stay away. Skittering can be heard from within. Inside is a wing of the dungeon containing a burrow having broken through the wall and an infestation of subterranean creatures of the DM’s choice. (Possibly of a high CR to make this optional wing and its loot a real challenge to the PCs)",
        "A patch of wall indiscernible from the rest of the dungeon except for the incredibly soft quality of the stone. A small alcove containing a slightly inhuman skeleton is on the other side.", "A room that has no gravity.", "A crack in the floor that constantly streams out a thin wisp of smoke. It smells of honey.", "A docile monster that is permanently invisible.", "A room with a large central pool in which an elemental lives, protecting a powerful artifact.", "The ghost of an adventurer that became lost in the dungeon years ago.", "Foolish forebears- Ghosts of an adventuring party that died there long ago. They re-enact the the moments leading up to their deaths with no notice of the players. They can help lead them through the dungeon, and even offer information the players don’t know. Eventually though they will lead the party into a trap or deadly encounter", "Nuka skeletons- A room with the charred skeletons of dead adventurers. The walls are burnt black with the only thing juxtaposing it being the perfect white silhouettes of their final moments. When the player’s backs are turned the silhouettes move, and begin attacking the players. The skeletons get up, and their burnt black bones come alive with fiery cracks not dissimilar to embers left in the bottom of a bonfire.", "Murder mystery spectacular-A doorway that leads into a well set dining room has an instant kill trap thst extracts people’s souls from their bodies. They now have to act as ghosts in a murder mystery dinner party, and can get back in their bodies once they have helped solve the mystery. They are unable to communicate with anyone directly, but they can ‘haunt’ things to send messages.", "Arachnid ally-A spider living in an old shoe offers information to adventurers for a modest fee. She can offer shortcuts, intel, and hidden passages", "Pilfering party-Another adventuring party has been stealthily following the party, and plan to jump them in the treasure room.", "No blinking!- As soon as the players step into this room the door locks behind them. The room is mostly normal with the exception that one wall has the words ‘no blinking!’ Written out in huge letters. If the players blink they see where the key is hidden, but only for a split second.", "A room filled with artifacts such as gems, ancient pots, weapons. Some are on pedestals but most are scattered on the floor as if someone has ransacked it but left everything inside. A small, golden statue of a dragon lies smashed by an empty pedestal, and at the end is a locked door with no keyhole. A large mirror leans against the wall on the left of the path. Reflected in it is the room, but with everything carefully arranged and the dragon statue unbroken on the pedestal. If the players attempt to steal anything, the pathway they came through liquidates and melts, across, trapping anyone inside the room and crushing anyone in the hall, until it is placed back where it was found. If the room is arranged like in the mirror, including mending the dragon statue, the door at the end slides open.", "A hole in the wall, about the height of human shoulders. There is something shiny on the deep end of the hole, however to reach that, you would have to reach inside, and it’s deep enough to swallow your arm up he shoulder. If you reach inside, something bites you, causing 1d4 piercing damage. If you reach inside again, nothing bites you and you are free to take the shiny thing. It’s a single goldpiece.", "An old gnome is sat on a barrel smoking a pipe in a corridor of the dungeon, where the path splits into two. He gives the players a pleasant smile, and starts chatting about the draught. If they ask about how he came to be there at gives a vague answer about knocking the area well and directs them down left corridor, promising it’s worth their while. If they do they find a backpack filled with old treasure worth 30gp and the skeleton of a gnome lying beside it. If they go back, the old gnome is gone without a trace.", "A large disk floats rotating, a few inches from the circular walls of the room. Through the cracks you can see a deep chasm. At even spaces around the walls there are open and empty tombs, each with a seal floating above it. If the players all venture into the disk it will activate and spin violently, using its centrifugal force to push the players into the tombs or the entrance or exit.", "The ghost of the now crumbling manor is not pleased that some adventures are taking his stuff, but instead of attacking, he tries to find some middle ground with the group so he can be left in peace.", "In front of the party is a large stone door, possibly of gnomish construction that is covered in thin grooves that seem to make out a labyrinthine maze. In the middle is large ruby red gem that, when touched, shrinks the party and puts them somewhere random inside of it. In order to re-enlarge themselves and exit the labyrinth (thus opening the door) they must find their way back to the gem that now looms menacingly overhead while dodging mechanical spiders and tiny traps.", "A tiny telepathic spider offers to show them to a secret shortcut to the end of the dungeon. When followed a phase spider ambushes the party and thanks its child for bringing home dinner", "A room with magical darkness cast upon it hides important clues, but the only thing that can dispel the darkness is a living chandelier over the player’s heads. The only problem is that the chandelier can feel pain and doesn’t want to be lit on fire. The party can try to convince the chandelier to let them light it or light it forcefully. If the latter then it screams bloody murder attracting any nearby enemies.", "In a completely filled treasure room a single sentient gold coin waits to liberate it’s brothers and sisters. As soon as the player’s backs are turned the gold coin begins animating 2d20 gold pieces a turn and they all make a break for it.", "In a large empty circular room in the middle of a tower is a flower surrounded by a ring of fur. If the flower is pulled the room shifts downward a few feet if the fur is ripped out it goes up a few feet. As soon as one is taken. It regrows as fast as it was pulled until it reaches the top or bottom level.", "At a junction of hallways, the players notice one hallway has a slight breeze accompanied by a slow, rhythmic wheezing. The air is slightly warm and has an acrid smell. If they seek out the source, it leads to an abandoned forge with an enormous billows. An enchantment keeps the forge warm, like a magical pilot light. The late forgemaster’s bones sit hunched at a workbench with various mechanical drawings. There are various trinkets around the room, some magical, some mundane. If the players take any of the items, they are attacked by a previously dormant construct that was sitting under a cloth in the corner of the room.", "The players begin to smell a faint scent of baking bread. Is it delirium, or does someone live down here? Bonus! The smell of baking bread is soon joined by the smell of roasting meat. If the players seek out the source of the smell, they find a crack in the wall that leads to an ancient banquet hall, inexplicably laid out with a feast.", "The party finds a door, barred and barricaded. If cleared, the door appears to have been hastily welded shut by pouring molten metal around the edges, and requires a strength check to open. (or some industrious chiseling) When opened, the doorway opens into a void, scattered with stars. The party may step through, and they walk on an invisible surface even with the floor of the dungeon. Who knows what could be found in this strange realm?", "A room lined with standing alcoves. The alcoves are inhabited by a body encased in (magical) crystal. A knowledge history check can date the bodies to various eras of history. Near a collection of empty alcoves is a body bearing an item of only recent styling, invention, or popularity.", "A barren room with a standing mirror at one end. The mirror is cracked, it appears someone took an axe or sword to it some time ago, but the magical runes around it’s edge still flicker faintly with power.", "A room that appears to be a shrine of some kind. It contains a 10 ft wide, 3 ft deep circular pool in it’s center. In the pool, there is a duck. The duck resists all attempts to discern it’s nature, for all intents and purposes, it appears as an ordinary duck. The duck is docile and is content to do regular duck things. If, at any point, a member of the party says ‘I wish…’ within 5 feet of the duck, it quacks, grants the wish, and disappears in a suitably appropriate and silly display.", "The dungeon is very cramped, smaller than usual hallways, doors just tall enough to fit through, etc. At the bottom of the dungeon is a large, cavernous chamber containing an enormous monster. Upon inspection, the chamber appears to be a sort of colosseum. The monster may be dead, undead, or alive, and may be immediately aggressive, or just want a friend. It has no understanding of how it got there.", "You come across an adventurer/adventurer party that has been magically bounded to a room so they can’t leave the area.", "There seems to be a weird hole in the wall that is pitch black. It doesn’t seem to have good magic or evil magic, in matter of fact, there is no magic coming from it. If an object is thrown into it, it shoots straight back dealing 1 damage. If a PC tries to get close, it automatically seals and reopens when no one is within 5 feet.", "When you enter the dungeon, after clearing the first few rooms of traps, you realize that the homeless had already cleared out the area and is now using it as a place to live and sleep in, they say it’s better than sleeping in the streets.", "The room is raining?", "You come across a nice looking devil statue in the middle of a room, after a DC 20 (Investigation) check, it turns out there is a button in its mouth, when pressed, the mouth closes shut dealing 2d4 piercing damage and you can see blood dissolving as it leaves your skin. After 10 seconds it reopens and the statue turns into an imp, this imp now serves under the PC that put their hand in the mouth.", "A reverse pit trap; a reverse gravity rune with the pit above instead of below.", "The hallway the party is currently in starts to fill with water at about a knee deep height. Waves begin to form on the opposite end of the hall and rush towards the party. Each character in the water must make a DC 13 Dex saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed back 10 feet.", "A dwarven fighter, The last survivor of her party, is trying desperately to dig her way out of the dungeon with her war pick. Unfortunately, just as you reach her she breaches the dungeon’s sewers and unleashes a giant crocodile and a swarm of rats.", "An enemy Hobgoblin wizard the party is fighting casts shatter and collapses one of the nearby crumbling dungeon walls, revealing the basement of a very confused and panicked Halfling couple.", "Pipes high up on the walls in this chamber are dripping some kind of emerald-green liquid into a wall-mounted fountain. The fountain is nearly full. A successful miscellaneous intelligence check tells you that it’s just liquid paint. Highly toxic paint, but just paint. The fountain drains into an adjacent room, which is completely knee-deep in the liquid.", "The room contains a number of flensed livestock hanging on hooks, as if you’ve entered a butchery. Alongside creatures appropriate for the area, there are some animals from far away, such as penguins if in a dungeon surrounded by desert. If the party waits long enough, something invisible takes one animal corpse off the hooks and drags it into an adjacent room, where it begins butchering it.", "You come across a group of kobold engineers repairing some traps that jammed or are otherwise damaged.",
        "This room contains an 8ftx12ft pool of opaque white liquid, framed by four columns with taut chains leading up to a recess directly above the pool. If any creature is fully submerged into the pool (which is 10ft deep), a large metal mold begins descending from the ceiling recess. It will stop shortly before contacting the liquid if whatever creature entered the pool didn’t get out in time, but will plunge fully into the pool when everything leaves. When the mold returns out of the pool in four(?) minutes, a solid white mannequin in the shape of the submerged creature is atop it. The mannequin animates when there are no witnesses directly observing it, and will stalk the creature it’s modeled after. Perhaps the dungeon denizens are aware of the room’s properties, and have managed to take control of the mannequins to make reinforcements.", "A bright lamp hanging on the wall in an otherwise dim hallway, next to a wooden door with thick hinges. The door is locked, but it has a small counter at about elbow height, and a panel above that will open up if anyone tries to open the door or knocks on it. A flickering, jittering undead asks ‘I’m afraid the library is currently closed to visitors, but may I help you find a book?’ It will bring one book of choice for each person within the next few minutes who asks for one, but will not give multiple books to the same person. Books can be requested by very specific parameters (author, edition, hardcover or softcover, title), or by saying something as vague as ‘I’d like a book on cows’, though vagueness is probably less rewarding. The books are deposited on the door counter. Once every person it sees has received a book, or after a few minutes, the undead, door, and lamp vanish, leaving behind an ordinary patch of wall.", "A broken down wall of the dungeon leads to a decently sized cave where five cow like animals with purple spots and luminescent horns are grinding their teeth against the stone walls to get the lichen growing inside this crumbling tunnel. If approached slowly they will ignore the PCs, but if the PCs get too close the biggest one will turn towards you and snort while the others run back into the tunnels. If the PCs continue to approach it will attempt to gore one of the PCs with its poisonous horns and will then gallop after its compatriots.", "A ghost and a corpse. The ghost is desperately trying to get back into its body so it can rescue its beloved, only it doesn’t realize that hundreds of years have passed and its beloved has likely died, if only from old age.", "A sentient chest, not a mimic and not enchanted. Somehow, in some way, the chest has become self aware. It cannot speak or see or hear or taste or feel, but it can ‘sense’ its surroundings somehow. With great effort it can open and close its lid, and with even greater effort it can move slightly across the floor. How the party learns to communicate with it is up to them.", "There is a helmet in the corner of this room/chamber. In the next room, there is an identical helmet. This continues for every single room afterwards. Any rooms visited before the first time the party noticed these helmets also have an identical helmet. If someone dons the helmet, they see all of the rooms of the dungeon at once, taking 2d12 psychic damage with a WIS save to halve the damage. This psychic damage occurs every time someone dons the helmet, but if they stick through with it rather than removing it, it can be used to get a brief glimpse of whatever an identical helmet would see in another room once every ten turns by passing a perception check. While someone wears a helmet, the other helmets seemingly vanish. Any damage or modifications inflicted to one helmet is performed on all the others.", "The party comes across a glittering egg about the size of an adult halfling in kaleidoscopic colors. If they break it open, there are… more eggs inside, about the size of a normal chicken egg but made of the same material and in the same colors. Each of these can be cooked like an egg, or the party could wait for one to hatch by keeping it heated; a nature check tells you these are basilisk eggs, but luckily newly hatched basilisks don’t have their petrification abilities. A nature check, even if successful, fails to explain why the eggs were inside a larger egg.", "There is a pile of gold coins, about 4500gp total. Whenever the DM so chooses (but within a day), they sublimate into thin air- it was all Prankster’s gold. If players return to the same spot, they’ll see empty vials that probably contained the liquid where the pile originally was, complete with labels detailing what the liquid does.", "As the party rounds a corner or passes through a chokepoint, a small glinting ball bounces on the ground towards them before exploding into a massive cloud of whitish smoke. The party’s been ambushed by some kind of clever, intelligent pack of hunters, hopefully appropriate to their level. The exits to the room are so small that attempts to blow the smoke away can only siphon away so much at a time.", "The party walks into a room to be met only by a button and next to it are scribbles seeming to make out “DO NOT TOUCH.” As the final party member enters the room, the door slams shut and the 4 walls of the room flip, revealing walls lined with spikes that slowly encroach on the party. The walls are indestructible and unstoppable, and every time the button in the center of the room is pressed, the walls recede back to their starting position only to crawl towards the party once more. The only way out if the situation is to heed the advice of the sign. Right as the walls are pressing the party members together, about to impale them all, the walls will reset, for good, and the door will reappear, letting the party escape. The trap can only be reset by having every member of the party leave and then reenter. A funny, harmless trap that will either starve a mistrusting group to death or make them panic.", "The walls of this room are lined with intricate carvings that appear to be dwarven in nature. They depict grand battles between dwarves and orcs that lead to a large set of stone double doors at the opposite end of the room. The doors depict a dwarf holding up a hammer that sparks with lightning. In the center of the room are 3 small pedestals and one larger pedestal in the middle. Each small pedestal has a stone tablet on it. Each tablet has a different word written on it: Others, Yourself, and Justice. To get the stone doors on the opposite side of the room to open, the party must put the tablets on the large center pedestal, placing Yourself on the bottom, Others atop it, and Justice at the very top. Once this is completed, the letters JOY will light up and the stone double doors swing open.", "Dave – An 78-year old human commoner who has no idea who was captured for slavery by the owner(s) of the dungeon – has a curse on him that activates after 1d4 days, and casts Fireball on him. The curse was applied by his ex, a vengeful witch who he had abandoned after learning of her true nature.", "A ghost bard of no fame who never got the chance to perform at the big show. He has come back from the great beyond to find that he can no long play his trumpet.", "A room which disguises itself as the childhood room of the first to enter. When enough people enter, the room locks. There is a significant difference that the one who first entered can spot with a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw to escape. Each time they fail, a nightmarish creature based on one of their childhood fears appears and the party must fight it.", "An eternal campfire burns in this room. The adventurers shadows appear on the dungeon wall, which turn into Shadows from the Monster Manual. The taller the adventurer, the more powerful the Shadow will be. The fire can only be put out by dousing it with holy water or some other curse removal.", "Party enters a smallish, circular room, with a simple wooden door. There is a wooden door on the far side of the room, locked. The room has nothing but a simple wooden table, upon which is a single vase, containing a large, dark purple flower. If the party investigates, the flower is nightshade, and the vase is of unknown origin. Everything here is ordinary, other than the table, which is a mimic. Let it lie still until after the party investigates the flower/vase (if at all), just for the extra surprise factor.", "The party finds a scared Gazer whimpering in a corner of a room. It will cry and whimper if the party approaches. If the party can earn its trust, it will hang around and give playful licks. What will happen when the party finds the Beholder searching for his pet?", "You come across a large furnace in a dead end of the cave. It’s a fancy, built-in brick oven. If you open its cast iron door you hear faint moans and echoes. Inside it is pitch black, even with darkvision you cannot see the bottom. If you drop a lit torch you see hundreds upon hundreds of zombies and other shambling undead monsters converging on the light until it is extinguished.", "A goblin named Sam smorkle who is just looking for rusty things. If given a rusty thing he’ll help you until the next rusty things is found, where he’ll quickly work himself up into a frenzy and accuse you of wanting the rusty item. Roll initiative.", "A labyrinth eventually leads to a center room. The room appears to be a study with a table in the middle featuring an exact scale model of the labyrinth, including miniatures of the PCs themselves. Another miniature can be seen, of some hideous monstrosity, and its heading for the center room…", "The party finds a tiny portal to the Far Realm. An impossibly huge eye is looking at them… then after a few seconds the portal snaps shut leaving behind an strange small polyhedral made of a hard unknown material that somehow inspires awe and fear.", "The party finds an gold vein that has been roughly ‘mined out’. If they follow it, they find a hive of rust monsters eating the ore. If disturbed the RMs with spill out into the dungeon and eventually the surface (maybe destroying a nearby village).",
