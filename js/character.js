He had wrestled Storm Giants to the ground, broken the neck of the great red wyrm Ixenvhir with his bare hands and sundered mountains with his greataxe. One day, the powerful Lich Acererak took notice of Bul'tar and made a bet with him. If Bul'tar could defeat all of his minions, Acererak would grant him unimaginable riches and treasure if not, Bul'tar would join his army of undead and guard Acereraks tomb for eternity. Bul'tar, confident in his might, agreed. Acererak then continued to summon his minions to fight the barbarian in a battle that would last an entire month and change the landscape forever. Mountains shattered, Earth became barren and everything within hundreds of miles was ground to dust. Bul'tar fought with every ounce of his almost inexhaustible strenght but alas, at the end he was overrun by the endless stream of undead and died, standing in a field filled with streams of his blood and the white powdered bones of millions of undead. Acererak, having won the bet, was nontheless impressed by this display of strenght and fashioned a Statue of Bul'tar out of the undead he had slain and his blood at the place he stood, before taking the corpse away and using it to create one of the mightiest protectors of his true tomb.

One party that I ran for killed her after noticing her kidnap a child that had been playing in a field.", "Kindness: This is more of a common set of myths of Gods coming down to the Material Plane and disguising themselves as random (often poor, crazy, or sick folks) people or animals in order to get to know people first hand. If people mistreat them, then they curse them or damn them. If they are treated well, they give Boons to the people, maybe by giving them special treatment in the afterlife, leaving gold and other gifts in places for them to “find”, making them just lucky or flat out intervening on their behalf. The God May also get more personally involved, designating that person and their bloodline as destined for greatness (maybe making them Aasimar, or a like of Clerics, Paladins, Sorcerers, and Warlocks). The stories vary by God, culture, region, etc. but they typically have the same common moral of being kind to random strangers (and really just everyone, including animals) in order to appease the Gods. This also actually happens, so sometimes a random villager may find a pot of gold after sharing bread, ale, and food stories with a weary traveler, or a party member may find themselves blessed after tossing a pouch of the dragon’s gold to that homeless child.", "The Forgotten Heroine: Long ago, an immense titan of Elemental Earth was corrupted by the Hells to be an infernal war machine, a hellish continent that would be the start of Hell on Earth. It’s presence would corrupt the nearby lands with Hell’s influence, but a group of strangers, divided by creed, occupation, background, and just about everything else, worked together to stop them. Their names have been lost to history, but their actions remembered. The strongest among them cleaved valleys in the Titans. The magician bound the titan in place, as if it were a continent. Both of them gave their lives in the process. But finally, the titan had to be subdued, the infection of the Hells driven from its vessel, so the bravest of the heroes, a mortal touched by the divine (though some scholars think her some once divine being fallen from grace), who plunged her blade into the titan and used it as a conduit to channel all of the divinity her mortal vessel could handle and through her and her blade the power flowed into the titan, destroying it and the Hellish infection and leaving behind a now barren continent. The Heroine herself was destroyed. In destroying the titan, she channeled so much of the power of the Gods that she became one with it (sort of akin to the Flash losing himself in the Speed Force should he go to fast), and she is now dispersed throughout the Positive Energy plane, living on as immortal divine power. The last of the strangers, a wise man attuned to the Natural World, took care of the continent and nourished it, allowing it to grow and flourish. No one remembers which of the continents it was, but legend says that a mortal, pure and brave of heart like the heroine of old, may find her blade still buried in the Earth, it’s hilt sticking out and beckoning them like a beacon.",

Once a month, they must satisfy its hunger.", "Last year, a few of the town’s eldest houses conspired and murdered every last person of their rival families.", "A seemingly peaceful village with almost no crime.

The villagers prefer one person pay a pint of blood every other week than half of everyone’s income every month.", "The town is made entirely out of mimics and shapeshifters.

None of its inhabitants and objects are evil, they merely want a life without conflict, and disguising as a village seemed to be the best way to achieve this.", "A medieval hamlet, that seems a bit too advanced to be medieval. The villagers are crazy efficient at everything they do, and each one of them seems is really intelligent. Upon closer inspection, or being a close friend of everyone in the hamlet, they will reveal that they are a group of time travelers who ended up in the wrong time, with no way back home.

Many adventurers have gone in and not come out, and their items are added to the loot the dungeon denizens create on their own, much of which is stored in a secure treasure room. But the village of Beton, a halfling village several miles away also has an entrance to this dungeon. The villagers that know about it (the local Smith, the elder chief, a gnome artificer, and a pair of halfling thieves) jealously guard the secret. Because their entrance secretly goes directly to the treasure room. A hidden artificer device lets the thieves know it is safe to sneak in. What they steal goes to the Smith who markets the items to passing adventurers as his own work. Every one gets a cut of the money made. The elder looks the other way when the thieves are caught in other heists.", "After an incident with some wandering magic caster and their local livestock, the villagers now have an unspeakable, deep-seated fear of chickens. The very mention of the animal’s name causes them to break out in a sweat. Mimicking the sounds they make has been known to cause bouts of screaming, fainting and hysteria. In addition, if they eat anything unknown they liken the taste to crocodile instead of chicken.", "The hamlet has a hive mind, and plans to take over the world… the fact that anybody born in the village who leaves loses their connection to the hive & dies, as well as outsiders being not effected, is lost on the poor thing.", "The village’s sheriff/law enforcer was murdered recently. As the PCs arrive to assume the role of new law enforcer, they find the townsfolk very pleasant and forward in trying to integrate the new arrivals.

It grants them peace, good crops, and safety… but those with greedy intentions would slay every inhabitant there to possess such a treasure.", "An ancient demon came here to live out the final three years of its life and has become attached to the town and its people. When a rival town came to attack, the entirety of the town was reported as missing.", "They’re a part of a interplanar underground railroad, for slaves trying to escape masters on other planes, ie a lot of Genies of the various elements keep slaves.

It has been 21 years…", "The hamlet’s somewhat famed ale is made by a misanthrope that takes a good long piss in every barrel they export from the hamlet.", "It appears to be the perfect image of a quaint fantasy village, known for having the lowest crime rate in the region. It has even won “Village of the Year” multiple years in a row. However, the local “Village Watch” seems suspicious, and there are a surprising number of “accidents” that seem to happen in the village, usually involving people or creatures that were seen as a threat to the quaint charm of the community.", "They once lynched a 4 year old girl for being a “witch”.

This belongs to a dragon, and anyone that the village members dislike are told about the secrets that await them in this cave.", "The villagers live in total symbiotic harmony with the nearby fae, and forest, with many even being part fae from previous unions. They all have some small level in wood shaping magic, and do not use iron.

When cut all the villagers bled sap.", "All the villagers are animals turned human by a lonely old wizard, who has now passed. They live out normal lives expect for a few odd behaviors.", "Several villagers robbed and murdered a small party that passed through town a decade or so ago. Among the stolen goods was a sentient weapon, which remembers everything and is just bursting to snitch on them. For lack of a good way to destroy and/or silence the sentient weapon, they buried it in an unmarked location out in the sheep pastures. Sometimes, when the wind is just right, you can still hear it calling for help.", "The true heir to the throne is being kept in the village, under the effect of a permanent Feeblemind or Amnesia type spell.", "The village gets most of its food by stealing from nearby farms and making it look like a blight.", "The entire village is a single organisms (such as an advanced mimic or powerful illusioner) attempt to lure in and trap wanderers.", "Everyone in the village is sterile.

The townsfolk are natives of both realms.", "The village is the creation of a wish of dying mother giving birth alone by a genie “I wish my child will be safe and loved.” The wish summoned powerful spirits to build and maintain a village to raise the now orphaned child. The village is slightly quirky, even more antiquated than a normal isolated village, but friendly. The village will turn overly protective when anyone seems overly interested in the child.", "An odd quirk of displacement magic shifts the shops locations in town at random at dawn, causing the villagers to build all buildings exactly the same to be able to house all the different shop requirements. The villagers try to pass this off as the local food “doesn’t agree with outsiders” and causes the confusion.", "Once a month the village is visited by an incorporeal entity to collect a ‘soul tax’.

If the pot breaks, the villager dies.", "As you spend time in the village you begin to get the sense that something is off. Try as you might you can’t shake the feeling that you don’t fit in. It’s as if the whole village is set up to work ever so slightly in a way that you’re unfamiliar with. If you roll a high enough perception you notice….. they are all left-handed. Burn them, burn them all!", "Unusually quite a few of the villagers are blind in one eye or both. No one dares to talk about it. They are also afraid of chickens. The village is secretly governed by an awakened chicken and her brood. Justice is harsh, anyone caught stepping out of line has an eye pecked out.", "This village is just an ordinary village.

This song has a part two called ‘Stuffing The Magic Dragon’ in which the party has the dragon stuffed and brought to their castle.", "‘The Deep One’s Sea Shanty’ – To anyone who can’t speak Aquan this sound sounds like an upbeat sea shanty sung in another language. To those who do speak Aquan it tells the story of ‘The One who causes the waves’ and how he fought the gods themselves to reclaim the sea as his own.", "‘Lycan Virgin’ – Famous wenching song punctuated by wolf howls. Werewolves struggle to resist joining in during these parts, as does anyone else who has had a few…", "‘Crossbow’ – A song about a Ranger who rides into town to collect a bounty, alive or dead, against the Barbarian Reckless Redd. ‘No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip, ‘cus the Ranger there among them had a crossbow at his hip.’", "‘The Wizard and the Wren’ – A children’s song about a wizard who built a wooden town taller than any in the land that was undone by a wren who needed twigs to build its nest.", "‘The Crown on the Head and the Crown on the Heart’ – An epic poem describing a king who was usurped and his journey of growth on his return to the throne.", "‘Ashkeeper’ – A slow and somber dwarven chant about the history of one of their oldest and deepest fortresses.", "‘Our Son Arsen’s Arsine Arson and Parson Carson’s Incarceration Assertion’ – This bar song is known for being a dangerous tongue twister, and requires a DC 20 perform or linguistics check to sing without a serious mouth injury. Failing the check results in being unable to sing or speak for 1d6 hours.", "‘My Shortest Love’ – a song about the love between an elf and a halfling (hence “shortest”).", "‘The Seven Dwarves’ – song about how seven dwarves help to rescue a human maiden poisoned by a female wizard.", "‘Blasphemy Song’ – a rhyming song where every verse is an insult to a god. It is usual sung at a speedy pace. Worshipers say any bard who sings the song will face divine retribution, but for most bards, this wasn’t their last song.", "‘The Seven Screw-ups That Saved the World’ – A song about an adventuring party in which the members kept dying but still managed to stop the apocalypse. Each verse is how they helped the party, and how they died is in the chorus: ‘There were Seven Screw-ups in the party in all, One sang with the banshee in the hall and then there were Six Screw-ups in the party in all’ Popularly altered to sing the praises of other unfortunate adventuring groups.", "‘Rocking Chair’ – A calm ballad about an old elven lady remembering the times when she was young and fierce.", "‘Cold Blows the Wind’ – The love ballad of a budding necromancer and the lover she lost to the sea.", "‘Letters in the Sky’ – A tragic tale about a prince exiled to the sun and a princess exiled to the moon, and how they can only express their love for each other by arranging the stars into messages. Usually, it ends with the performer gazing skyward on the final chorus.", "‘Pahoot’ – A children’s song (best played on the flute or piccolo) that parents roll their eyes at while their children giggle. It features verses about the exploits of Pahoot, the flatulent goblin, who somehow always gets the last laugh whenever he’s ostracized for his odor.", "‘Where You’ve Been’ – A song about a ranger who searches for his lost love, using his tracking skills, but he’s delayed by his memories of the locations he visits.

        "‘The Shortening of Meradian Finn’ – A Dwarven drinking song with thirty-eight official verses (and countless unofficial ones), the song recounts the punishment meted out against an Elven noble who stole from a Dwarven treasury. The chorus ends with a rousing slamming of glasses and a ‘in the end, he never did again!’ It is considered poor taste by many elves, which helps account in part for its popularity.", "‘The Bawdy Body of Biddy Badee’ – A raucous account of an old woman accidentally restored to youth and beauty. The song makes liberal use of alliteration and plays on words: ‘her newly charmed charms were enchanting enchantment; passing by barracks led to guardsman advancement…’", "‘The Cruel Changeling’ – A mournful ballad of a wandering bard falling for a woman at a fair, only to discover that she is wearing another’s face.", "‘And All for a Turnip’ – A song best sung as a round.

A melancholy ode to loss, some have taken it as a representation of the Elves’ sense of mourning for the loss of their brighter world.", "‘I Eldalië Snuiiiiii (The last word is used to sound like snoring or deep breathing)’ – A parody of the Elven Dirge ‘I Eldalië Nairii’, the song is of unknown source; it tells of an Elven bard singing the dirge, while the listeners fall asleep from boredom. A sure way to insult the singer of such a dirge, it is best sung with as much false pomposity as possible.", "‘But the Gnome Was Never Seen’ – A children’s song, used to remind Gnomish youths about the importance of caution and care.", "‘Adam the Easygoing’ – A relaxed song telling the tale of the titular Adam, a large, pudgy human paladin with an odd knack for befriending those he defeated in combat.", "‘I Write the Spells’ – A catchy if somewhat easily grating little song of unknown origin. If sung, it makes certain wizards go absolutely berserk.", "‘Nyarna Nwalcamun’ – The Saga of the Hero Grefedd and his journey to destroy the sentient cursed sword Nwalcamun. Traditionally, the climactic final battle scene is punctuated by the beat of a hammer on an anvil, representing Grefedd’s smashing of Nwalcamun while under attack by a drow army.", "‘The Green Eyes of Mallistari’ – The wooing song of a human woodsman for a half-elven maiden ‘met in a shady glade.’ The song is notable for a memorable bridge, often used when teaching the lute.", "‘Ga-Grosh For-Thaash’ – A song adapted from an Orcish marching anthem, useful for learning the rudiments of Orcish.", "‘The Oysters of Miss Marchelle’ – A sea shanty, recounting the joys of stopping in port at an establishment called ‘Harbor Belle.’ The song declares that ‘no sailor can resist the delight of the oysters of Miss Marchelle.’ The shanty, unlike many such songs, is not clearly innuendo, although it certainly may be (and many sailors sing it as such).", "‘Arnash Quadmatter’ – A song mocking the quintessential absent-minded wizard, referring to the foibles caused by having ‘his nose in a book, a book, a book…’", "‘The Missing Child’ – A mournful Elven song about a mother looking for her lost child, eventually going mad with grief and drowning herself, only to rise again as a banshee." < "‘Grandma Got Eaten By An Owlbear’ – A Popular song in winter months reminding people that they shouldent allow their elderly ex adventuring grandmother to attempt to wrestle monstrosities.", "‘You Can Just Call Me The Gnome’ – A fast-paced, silly song telling the increasing exploits of Hamish McTamish, a fictional gnome adventurer. Each time the chorus is sung, Hamish’s name is lengthened with more titles (the last chorus includes as many silly titles as the singer can think of and can sing in a single breath) followed by ‘but you can just call me the Gnome!’ Although believed to be human in origin, gnomes love the song, and an informal competition has sprung up as to the longest final chorus. The current record belongs to Sprigvill Gaudynack, who (via both her own talent and magical augmentation) kept the last chorus going for three and a half minutes.", "‘Callaud’s Pre-funeral Dance’ – A sprightly instrumental air for country dances. If played with a performance check DC 18 or higher, it functions like ‘Otto’s Irresistible Dance’ for anyone not in combat or threatened (i.e. it will make listening townsfolk break out into dance, but not if you are in the midst of robbing their homes).", "‘Long, Gone Galangal’ – A love story told through Gamelan music about an adventurous Chef seeking a rare root in the forest. Instead of finding it, they find the love of their life. The song is quite long, requires a large number of musicians to play properly, and has a happy ending.",
        "‘Untranslateable Orcish Proverb’ – A morality tale operatically told through Carved Masks, Huge Percussion Instruments (Taiko style Drumming), Slapstick Pantomime, and Throat Singing techniques. A classic of High Orcish culture, now practically lost to time and the collapse of High-Orcish society. The choregraphy is quite energetic.", "‘Great-Grandmother Will Enjoy Eating Your Flesh An Orchestral Eladrin Morality Tale from the Far Fey Realms’ – A bold hero cheats and fails to respect the ancestral Mother-spirit. The mother spirit holds the hero to his deal and devours him for his crimes. The tale is told non-verbally, through colorful illusion and intepretive dance.", "‘My Lord, Come-a-Leaping’ – A bawdy Halfling tale about a Randy Prince who is turned into Frog when he comes on too strong to a powerful and beautiful Halfling Sorceress, and discovers he likes being a Frog more than a Ruler.", "‘The Farmer’s Corn’ – A bawdy tale about a comely farmer’s daughter who mishears something someone said, and spreads gossip around the village.", "‘The Three Spinners’ – A children’s Tale retold through a tongue twisting call and response song. It is about three unmarried magical Farm-women who challenge that they can out-spin (thread) better than anyone. They challenge a devil, who curses one with a swollen foot, one with an infected finger, and one with an infected lip. The woman with the infected lip’s line is supposed to be sung while holding one’s tongue. In the end, the women win, the devil is defeated, and each one wins more gold than they know what to do with.", "‘The Town with No Name’ – ‘I came across a pokey town. Not much going on and curtains all down. I came across a smokey tavern. Not much going on in that pokey town.’ A slow sad song about a old woman that lost her way and found a town not on any maps they brought and only too late discovered it to be a ghost town. (Actual ghost town not just one that was abandoned).", "‘Beware A Human Bard’ – A pseudo-cautionary song about the lascivious characteristics of human bards; the song begins with an Elvish mother warning her daughter, and proceeds through all the more common races into more and more ridiculous warnings (‘Mama Golem warns that he’ll say he likes your rocks, but what he’s really thinking of…’)", "‘The Fall of the Sun’ – A mournful Aarakocra ballad, said to have been written by the first to travel from the Elemental Plane of Air and see a sunset.", "‘The Cheese Song’ – ‘Cheese Cheese Cheese Cheese Cheese Cheese Cheese Cheese Cheese Cheese’ A song used by Kenku bards who create melodies out of the different voices and accents they have heard the word in the songs they sing.", "‘Glida’s Wedding’ – A traditional halfling travel song, describing the setup for a halfling wedding, ‘held in the shadow of the wagons on a Summer Sunday.’", "‘The Flute & Lute’ – A ‘dueling instruments’ style song featuring the eponymous instruments. While some bards have added words to the lute portion, it is usually simply instrumental.", "‘Bear Bride’ – A song about a human maid, enchanted by a fair traveler into leaving her home, who meets a sad end when she discovers the traveler is a dangerous druid.

The song is both nostalgic and melancholy.", "‘The Solemn Judge’ – A song about an irascible old magistrate, his beautiful daughter, and the blacksmith’s son who falls for her. The last verse tells of the judge marrying the happy couple.", "‘Fleshy Pinklings’ – An Orcish Festival song, championing the power of the Orcish races and declaring their superiority over the rest of the world, and their destiny as conquerors.", "‘Cloth in the Street’ – A protest song, originally written in Malthcumband, calling for weavers to rise up against an unjust leader. Banned in many evil-aligned areas, the song calls for the people to rise up and take back the city. Ironically, one of the governments to ban the song is the tyrannical Communal Autocracy of Malthcumband, formed by many of the same weavers the song was first written for.", "‘The Colors Of Death’ – A colorful tale of how an adventuring party was brutally murdered by all the chromatic dragons at once.", "‘Well Well Well’ – A song relating how several people did mischief and subsequently fell into a hole in the ground. The chorus starts with: ‘Well Well Well, look who fell here!’.", "‘To The Death’ – A marching song about a young soldier who plans on dying bravely to defend their homeland, and asks their leader to write a letter home for them to their one true love. It was quite popular long ago, but is now considered cloying and outdated.", "‘Ale for the Victorious’ – A popular drinking song sung by soldiers while off-duty.", "‘To My Lover’s Lover’s Love’ – A downer of a song, this tear-jerker is a letter dictated, postmortem, by a forlorn lover telling all the sordid and dirty deeds of their former lover, now in the arms of another.", "‘Sir Dalloway the Duelist’ – A song from a hundred years ago, poking fun at nobles and fragile honor. It was once considered unlawful to sing it in polite company, but it is now a popular folk ballad that is quite catchy.", "‘Rhetting the Flax’ – A work song about how many bales of flax a young and ambitious villager promises to grow, harvest, prepare, spin, weave, and sell, so they can have enough fabric and gold for a huge wedding, if only their lover would return their affection. The song is a thinly veiled sexual innuendo.", "‘The Horrible Haggis of Hampstead Heath’ – A rhyming cumulative song about a mimic that swallows an farmer’s old, rotten haggis, gains magical powers, and then goes on a rampage. It devours an entire town, where every occupant, their occupation, their children, and the name of their family pets are listed. At first no-one stops it because they are too self-centered. In the end, the town’s guards and even the mayor are devoured. The song has a happy ending as the unlikely hero lets themselves get devoured and then slices open the mimic from the inside, releasing everybody safe and sound. The best bards are able to keep the crowd going for an entire hour, and then recite in reverse order the entire population of the village.", "‘Ogre-Melon Crawl’ – A catchy ditty which is a comedic precautionary tale about walking and not riding a horse if you have been drinking Ogre-Melon wine.", "‘Two Hundred and Seventeen Heartbeats’ – a controversial Elven composition. The singer takes a breath, then measures their pulse in silence for the duration that the title implies, while the audience is meant to slowly embrace the many natural sounds taking place during that time as a song of their own.

Excluding the alchemical ingredients, such as the eyes or heart (which must always be consumed raw if used in magical recipes or rituals), most of a dragon is meat, just like any animal. After the arduous task of scaling (best done with the beasts own claws or teeth), the meat must be cooked on an incredibly hot flame, regardless of species. It is believed to be physically impossible to overlook dragon. Also, the dragons tongue is entirely edible. Often considered an alchemical ingredient, it can be cooked or dried into jerky. It often holds a little innate magic, transferring the knowledge of languages the creature knew in life, if any. An interesting (and tasty) way to learn some new words.", "Gryphon sirloin: Often utterly ruined by the casual adventurer, the Gryphon should be butchered by a professional whenever possible. A well prepared, fresh Gryphon sirloin will often fetch as much money as the party will receive from felling the beast in the first place!

Plenty of meat on an Owlbear too.", "Roast Behir: The only way to enjoy the multi-legged dragon lookalike. After removing the electric glands and other organs, the meat of a Behir should be either smoked or roasted. Most adventurers miss out on the best flavour of this mountain dwelling creature.

This dished is traditionally served in a family style fashion by dumping in a large pile on a table and dumping additional spices directly on top.", "Fondgoo: An insane eccentric aspiring gourmet turned adventurer developed this after a horrific adventure in a ooze laboratory. Combining the jelly of a gelatinous cube with copious amounts of cheese and wine over high heat, you are able to neutralize most of the acidic elements to create an amazing dish. A mild anesthetizing effect tickles and numbs the mouth, preventing speech for a minute after consumption. Some consider this a boon and it is a frequent dish at many upper-class family reunions.", "Flesh Fondgoo: Captured by a human from beyond the stars with an unnatural hunger, the chef only had servitude as a survival option. Becoming comforter and preparer of meals, the new take on the fondgoo proved to be delectable with the right ingredients. Thin slices of half-orc proved to be the most popular with the star cannibal and his crew, wildly rich with only mild game flavor from the mixed heritage. The gourmet would never admit it to anyone, but his refined palate preferred the gnoll. The terror only ended after discovering what they thought was a holy grail, a Hungering Flesh that went from cornucopia to consumer in no short order.", "Roasted Phoenix: When you’re done, you toss the bones in the fire and *pop* the phoenix is back. Also, you can always cook it just right; if you keep going, then it loops rare through well done.", "Forever Stew: made with a bit of troll meat which is still regenerating. If managed carefully, one only needs to add vegetables and can continue making a meaty stew night after night, indefinitely.

It is served with Rice and Potatoes. This Dwarven dish has been since outlawed, with the discovery of the complexity of Flumph society.

As such, it’s often sought out by adventurers tired of eating the same old dried meat when on the road.", "Dry Stirge: this is a common folk food. In places with Stirge infestations, meat is often spoiled as these tiny creatures suck all of its blood and nutrients. Because of that, locals recur to it to replace their meat. The Stirge is prepared on a campfire, but because of the many types of blood that it sucks, it often leads to the eater contracting some sort of disease.", "Party meat: Nobody knows who had the terrifying idea of powdering sugar on Kruthik tissue, but certainly it was a madman.

The Heat immune properties of the Remorhaz become fallible after their death, but they still require extremely high temperatures to be able to cook. Think smelting furnace, not oven. With such high temperatures required, Remorhaz needs to be cooked by eye due to the limited availability of such heat sources.

Sufficiently heated Remorhaz meat will stay hot for hours, even up to a day or two, keeping any stew it is added to hot as long as you wish.", "Roasted Bulette Flank: Bulette flesh is damnably tough and needs to be slow cooked with extreme patience. Combine red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, mustard, rosemary, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste to make a marinade.

For a bit of added fun, they are best served on the toe nail.", "Rib-hirs: Behir’s are nasty buggers, but they’re good for one thing: ribs. The longest rib cage you will find, gather up your town, or the local goliath tribe, and you’ll make a killing off of these. Flay the scales and smoke at a low heat over hickory logs for 2 days, slowly rotating the ribs through. A nice baste of dwarven ale mixed with citrus, or a rub of an orcish spice blend will make this a meal to remember. Just keep in mind the smell will travel for miles, so you might attract a nearby Roc.", "Roc Stock & Balor: While not actually made with Balor flesh, this demonic delicacy is as the name implies a stew made from Roc stock and any sort of demonic flesh.

After spending many years living among the dwarves, Weatherbee made his way home with a drink even the stout folk couldn’ t handle. This monstrosity is laced with latent magic designed to lessen the chance of drinkers dying from its ungodly alcohol content, and reportedly tastes like 'A kick in the face from a horse.' After one shot of this drink, the drinker is shunted into a chaotic haze of blurry awareness, bolstered confidence, and overpowering drunkenness. In addition, the latent magic in the brew causes minor, uncontrolled magical effects to occur around the drinker at random times during the haze.

In reality it’ s a few seconds.", "Nine Steps – commonly known as‘ The Niner’ or by it’ s full name‘ Nine Steps to Hell’. It is a liquid that when left to settle separates into 9 parts, the bottom one being pure black and the top a beautiful red with a gradient in between. After drinking it the person seems frozen for a few seconds, but to the person who gulpes it down it feels like days, weeks, maybe even months of 9 different experiences, all basically a form of torture. Often used as a torture method but sometimes drunk to prove ones mental strength, as those that can’ t endure it go insane. The niner is a rare drink because it’s extremely hard to make.

            "Stranger's Heart - Made from leaves of the Succubus Kiss, a parasitic red vine with lip shaped leaves that wraps around young trees, this bitter tea makes you feel in love for a few minutes but with no one in particular. Can be addictive for some people.", "Mountain Fire - Made from Scorched Berries that grown at the base of some volcanoes. The berries are poisonous but once boiled and then dried they can be turned into a spicy drink that fills you with warmth and releases tensions in the body. Drinking more then one cup might make you sweat profusely.", "Morning Sun - Made traditionally from a mix of orange peels and Croissant Lotus petals by monks of the Zenchu River, this bittersweet infusion helps with morning grogginess and giving a productive an early start. Also helps to resist sleep spells.", "Gundyr's Ice Breaker - A bestseller during flu season, this algae based infusion has a strong salty taste but will clear your airways in minutes. Despite it's usefulness, only few people would risk collecting the Ice Grappler Algea that grow under the ice of frozen lakes. Gundyr is on of them.", "Sharp Moonlight - A tea made from the petals of a flower (from a cactus) that blooms only under the moonlight. The leaves must be harvested and processed before the morning, when the petals will, if left to their own, have all wilted. In small amount, Sharp Moonlight helps people sleep, but larger doses can produce hallucinogenic dreams. Many report feeling as if they were one with the moon themselves.", "Khârt (pronounced Curt with a hard c) - A dwarven tea made from the Khyr fungus, which only grows deep underground and physically resembles the black truffle. The tea possesses a bitter, spicy, and pungent aroma and is a potent stimulant, with its precise effects varying depending on method of preparation and the precise provenance of the khyr. The most commonly found type has the khyr being finely minced, dried, and pressed into bricks for easier storage and transport. This tea instills alertness and creativity with a slight sense of euphoria, making it a prized commodity amongst wizards, philosophers, and courtiers in many lands (albeit most prefer to add other things to mask the taste), and a major dwarven trade good.", "Forge-Fire - Whilst Khârt is a common beverage with not very much cultural significance to the dwarves, forge-fire is a brew steeped in ceremony, and it is only consumed by dwarven masters of a craft before undertaking a great endeavor, whether it be a warrior leading a charge against an enemy army, a runeworker making a gate impervious to ram or explosive, or a smith forging the armor of a king. The khyr used in forge-fire is of the highest quality, and the most prized for forge-fire is khyr found growing upon the graves of a dwarf's ancestors or prior masters of the art, as the dwarves believe those specific fungi are gifts from the ancestors and hold some of their skill. Forge-fire is prepared by the drinker in a ritual that takes around 6 hours, during which the dwarf meditates on their ancestors, their training and knowledge, and the magnitude of the task ahead. The tea itself is prepared rather strangely: the khyr is finely sliced and placed into a wide and shallow bowl (often an ornate heirloom) and over it is poured strong mushroom brandy. The mixture is set alight and the heat from the burning, along with the tincturing from the alcohol, produce the infusion. A final incantation is sung and the brew is drunk whilst it is still burning. The brew fills the user with single-minded focus and vigor, making their movements swift, sure, and tireless, with many under its effects being known to work without stopping for days or even weeks. However, the aftereffects are extremely unpleasant, almost as if their life energy itself has burned up, and often leave the dwarf bedridden for months, and those who have consumed it claim to have felt that they utterly lost themselves in the chorus of ancestors and the purity of the craft, . In all dwarven history, few have consumed the forge's flame thrice, and none have survived it.", "Corpses Caffeine - Made from the petals of a corpse flower. When crushed they can be turned into an orange paste that can be infused in hot water to make a bitter but smooth tea. This tea makes you more aware of dead organisms near you.", "Nature’s wake - Made from an old ritual flower used by Druid’s to talk to nature. The petals of this flower are a bright and luminous white but, when dropped in boiling water, the liquid turns black with patches of green. Stir for 10 minutes and drink in one sip is the recommended brewing and drinking time. If brewed and drank correctly, nature will keep you safe for 24 hours. Examples of this would be nature guiding you out of a forest, trees protecting you like a shield.", "Leafwalker's Sensation - Crushed and dried leaves and sprigs from a Dryad's very own branches. The taste isn't different from other green teas, but it's magical warmth will flood inside your throat and belly. If the ingredients were gifted from a dryad, this tea will nourish and soothe to your inner core -mind, body and soul- and awakens your connection to the Fey for a short while. Just don't drink any that was harvested from a dead or unwilling Dryad...", "Dragon’s Balm - Sometimes chewed, this spiky leaf is known to any wood-witch or hermit worth their salt - a common sight among roadside plants and overgrown gardens. When brewed the leaf gives off a strong smoky aroma - drinking it makes your breath smell slightly of woodsmoke and brimstone. The short term effects are as a mild stimulant - a particularly potent brew might help someone work tirelessly for several hours or walk twice as far in a day. Those under its effects seem artificially chipper and may talk more than they mean to. The aftereffects are marked; a mild and not unpleasant lethargy usually followed by a deep and untroubled sleep. Valued by travelers and those living in peaceful locales for its use in travel and ease in ensuring a full night’s rest, the wise avoid its use when danger looms or work must continue at great length - the sleep of Dragon's Balm is difficult to rouse from and the lethargy lasts until the body is allowed to completely rest. Repeated use runs the risk of dependence, and the tea will begin staining the teeth orange over time.", "Ghostflower Tea - Used by mediums and those who wish to commune with the dead - this tea must be prepared in a special ritual lasting an hour. The ritual involves selecting the proper leaves and bulbs from this unassuming but rare white-gold flower and painstakingly removing the tiny black pods that spread from the flower’s open bell. Each pod must be shucked and its contents ground, but when the tea is finally imbibed the user can interact with and speak to the dead. The imbiber will be wreathed in a soft glow for the duration, and appear translucent under moonlight. Given a strong enough dose, they will be able to pass through flimsier solid objects - this effect is rare and taking too much Ghostflower tea is dangerous. The dead become attracted to those who drink this tea; an unlucky medium may drink to speak to a lost loved one or question a murder victim or ancient lord only to find themselves the focus of every unquiet dead or revenant for miles around. Drinking poorly prepared tea or drinking two doses in a single changing of the moon (a month) can give the imbiber intense visual hallucinations and make them violently ill; they have been known to speak at length to visions of their dead loved ones or ancestors and carry out battles against imaginary foes. The skin of a victim of Ghostflower poisoning will be pale and flushed; the blood will not clot and they bleed freely. Those with weak constitutions may perish. Individuals who die while under the effects of ghost flower tea are more likely to become spirits themselves.", "Moon Tea - Brewed by witches, midwives, queens and bachelors - this tea is from an uncommon leafy plant of green-grey leaves. Bitter smelling but sweet on the tongue, having two cups of this at most an hour before coitus will prevent pregnancy. Some claim it heightens sensation and others that it ages the body, but when taken by any sex its efficacy is renowned. Babies born from unions where one or both parent take this tea are considered lucky by many, and the child of such a union is often marked by green flecks in their eyes. This plant is harvested so regularly that what was once a common sight in every garden and back patio has become a valuable commodity; this is because improper harvesting yields sufficient quantities for a dose while killing this fragile plant.", "Willwillown - a common long leaf tea that grows on hillsides and is hardy. Usually drunk as a before midday tea but has several flavored varieties by mixing it with florals like Rill or Munlack or Pepper Flower, or with citrus peels. Gnomes like it baked rather than air dried as it rounds out the body, but they also brew it strong and tanneny which others find unpleasant. Dwarves will sometimes chew Willwillown berries but humans find them bitter and unpalatable.", "Moradin's Loose Leaf - Made from the leaves of Ironwood and a proprietary blend of black tea leaves steeped in a forge's quenching bucket. Gives the drinker renewed vigor to continue hammering, bending and cutting long past many of the younger dwarves.", "Avlat - Made from leaves of a vine that grows wild in poor soil. Brews a peppery, copper-colored tea that is a bit of an acquired taste, but often is used to accentuate other bold flavors, such as those found in rich wines, sauces, and ales.", "Beorunna's Cure-All Named, oddly enough, for a legendary barbarian queen credited with its discovery, this bitter-tasting tea made from boiled stems located in the Savage Frontier has taken on an austere reputation among healers and herbalists. The first time a creature that consumes this tea regains hit points from any source in the following hour, they regain 2d4 additional hit points.", "Blackthorn - Brewed from the leaves of the blackthorn shrub, producing a savory tea with earthy woody notes, and a fruity, tangy aftertaste. This tea is known to calm an upset stomach, and is remarkably common in the Dragon Coast and Dragon Reach.", "Blueleaf - Harvested from the leaves of the bitterhedge plant, plentiful throughout the Realms and used to ward off common crop parasites. When brewed, creates an off-blue tea that is slightly sweet with an almost minty aftertaste. Many enjoy this tea recreationally, though used medicinally it suppresses nausea and dysentery for 8 hours after consumption.", "Chalthorn - Made from grey, furry weeds that plague farmers in Sembia and the Dalelands, this cloudy tea has a dry, chalky taste that is difficult to like. However, when a creature drinks this tea, it becomes unable to taste spice in food for one hour, rendering the most spicy of cuisine palatable.", "Coffee - A potent drink with a bold, robust yet bitter flavor, energizing to those that drink it. A creature cannot sleep or be put to sleep by any means for an hour after drinking coffee.", "Coffee, Dwarvish - A thick, sluggish liquid, almost syrupy in texture and black as midnight.

The drink of choice for the entire eastern Inner Sea.", "Feverbalm - This tea is brewed from small multi-colored red, black, and yellow flowers found in the Savage Frontier. Drinking this tea calms the mind and numbs the throat and tongue, suppressing any madness effects the character suffers for one hour.", "Gaeth'ad - A tea brewed by the orcs of the Shadow Marches, tasting thick and brackish, with a flavor that stays on the tongue. A versatile if incredibly pungent drink, it can be  brewed as a mild stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic, depending on methods used when brewing.", "Jethur - Purplish and (usually) as savory as broth, this tea is made from dense clusters of fungi known as carpet mushrooms. The taste of this tea is known to shift as one drinks it, and it is renowned by merchants for its ability to induce sobriety and soothe digestion. A creature that drinks this tea suppresses the effects of any alcohol in their system for 2 hours.", "Long Jing - A rich and fragrant green tea, grown in Kara-Tur’s Zhejiang province. Tradition holds that this tea can help cleanse the body of toxins, granting a creature that drinks it resistance to poison damage for one hour after consumption.", "Mallow - This light blue floral tea is popular in Maztica, often finding use as a sleep aid. It carries a light semi-sweet taste. If a creature drinks this tea before sleeping, they sleep free of nightmares and cannot be affected by the dream spell or similar abilities.", "Meiriath - A rich copper-colored beverage tasting of mango and citrus, popular with wealthy residents of Halruaa, Unther, and Mulhorand. Made from carefully-dried leaves of cave-sedge, a grass-like plant that grows in caves and other dark places.", "Mother's Leaf - A mellowing concoction, carrying with it strong grass and sage notes, a staple of healers in the Savage Frontier. If a creature that drinks this tea suffers from any diseases, they can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 13. On a success, one disease the creature suffers ends gradually after 24 hours.

Often served ceremonially at funerals.", "Nararoot - A shaved-down tuber seeped into a tea, its natural licorice flavor is softened into a musky semi-sweet aroma. This tea functions as a form of birth control; a female humanoid that drinks this tea is rendered infertile for a period of 2 weeks. A similar tea for male humanoids is derived from cassil, though that tea costs 10 gp for every 1/20 lb.", "Pale Jade - A light and airy white tea, cultivated in Kara-Tur, primarily within Shou Lung. A popular export, many merchants and tea connoisseurs hold this tea as an excellent introduction to proper tea drinking.", "Par-Salian's Blend - A smoky, citrus-rich blend of herbs that soothes the throat, passed down between the magi of Krynn.
