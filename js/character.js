If the aasimar is a sneaky sort, reflections of a tremendous shadowy thunderhead appear instead. Clashing weapons or shields with an ideological opponent causes the aasimarâs weapons and gear to throw a torrent of sparks.`, `The aasimar never makes misspellings or simple grammatical mistakes in her writing ever. Her handwriting is swift yet flawless. Even the aasimarâs signature is charismatic.`, `The aasimar can instinctively tell if a written contract presented to her has deceptive intent. The aasimar notices the overall malice of the author hiding within the handwriting and parchment, but the aasimar must use her own wits to discover the precise catch.`, `When the aasimar concentrates on a small cloud for a long time, it slowly shapes itself into a rough impression of what the aasimar desires. (Cannot be used for skywriting, the precision is too demanding.)`, `The aasimar has a knack with much loved heirlooms. The rust on heirloom armor simply flakes off with a little care, grandpaâs broken clock starts running again with a little tinkering, and a childâs ripped stuffed animal practically sews itself together.`, `If the aasimar takes ten minutes to attune to a location where a worship service was held in the past day and night, she can hear pieces of the worship service that took place. This sense works even when the aasimar is deaf.`, `The aasimar always includes a little mud or spit in her medical care. The healing doesnât work as well when the aasimar leaves them out, but the recipes donât perform when other people try to make them.`, `His/Her blood gives advantage to driving out demons from possessed people. It gives off a light smoking effect and visible pain by both parties.`, `They are constantly followed by a pair of mourning doves that occasionally drop berries in front of them.`, `Any silk cloth they wear for a day makes it nearly impossible to be zombified when used as a burial shroud.`, `If they sneeze into a pure white handkerchief, they can open it to release a dove, who flies away. Sneezing into a normal handkerchief turns it pure white`, `If they focus, their ears are able to hear any prayer or cry for help in 100 feet, no matter the sound level or other distraction.`, `They cry tears of blood, which paradoxically cleans any object used to wipe them away.`, `On sunny days, they sparkle a little in the light, as if they had been dusted with glitter`, `People who sleep near the aasimar find that they sleep more restfully and contentedly than they have in a long, long time.`, `Jokes they tell are just funny. No explaining it. Even the worst, most unfunny joke told by the aasimar is met by a wry chuckle.`, `If they touch the face of a dying enemy, they get advantage on checks made to convince them to release the information the aasimar seeks.`, `Once per day, re-roll a failed ranged attack made against an enemy â the projectile has inexplicably bounced off of nearby objects to strike the enemy from behind!`, `They can attune to an object to make it hum an accompanying melody to a song of their choosing, with a range of 30 feet.`, `If they trip or stumble, they always find something interesting on the ground in front of their face â a gold coin, a perfectly round stone, a piece of wood that kind of looks like a religious figure.`, `The aasimar can sleep under blankets comfortably even on the hottest, must humid evenings.`, `Theyâve never lost a thumb war, and can always guess how many fingers youâre hiding behind your back.`, `People nearby the aasimar can now detect untraceable poisons in their food, with just enough time to react.`, `Dirt, grime, and sludge is wicked away from their clothing.`, `Their touch can relieve the elderly of their aches and pains for a week`, `Criticisms and observations made by the aasimar convince the target of the comments to turn their life around and improve their situations.`, `Light always reflects in a way that makes them appear as if they are standing in a column of heavenly light, even if the reflections are not logical.`, `Their teeth are always pearly white, and never fall out. Their baby teeth grow as the rest of them does, and they always fall perfectly into place throughout the growth process.`, `Dirt and debris seem to be physically incapable of sticking to their body. Coming into contact with anything of the sort results in the offending material sliding right off of them.`, `When in love, a faintly colored glow hangs in the air around them and gently reaches out towards the object of their affections whenever they are nearby. The exact color of the glow is unique to the individual aasimar.`, `Whenever they feel indignant, righteous, or justified, the faint pounding of drums can be heard echoing around the minds of all those nearby. The speed and intensity of the drumming increases with the strength of their passion.`, `When someone of the opposite gender approaches an Aasimar, they get âhot under the collarâ and are more likely to do things for them.`, `Depending on their ancestry, an Aasimarâs general appearance will be vastly different from another. If theyâre a descended of a Celestial or other holy being that was related/associated with the sun, then their body might give off a soft glow at night, their iris may look like an actual sun slowly revolving, and/or they have a greater affinity to heat.`, `An Aasimar may have two vertical lines going down their back near their shoulder blades as if there use to be wings there.`, `If an Aasimar lays under an old tree that tree will become more vibrant and alive as well as being able to bear fruit after the Aasimar leaves.`, `Aasimar and Tieflings can sense one another within 200 ft of one another.`, `The weather always seems to reflect the mood youâre in that day. Itâalways sunny when youâre happy; raining when youâre sad; and when youâre angry, there have been horrific storms`, `The smell of freshly baked bread follows you wherever you go.`, `Inexplicable memory for things that happened years before their birth.`, `Innately knows the spell calm emotions and can use it once per day.`, `Always knows the direction and distance to the nearest place of worship.`, `They cannot get drunk, and all alcohol tastes vile to them.`, `Any string instrument they play is instantly tuned to perfection.`, `When they sing, it sounds like a hundred voices singing in perfect harmony.`, `You dream of a wonderful, serene place whenever you sleep. If someone sleeps nearby or with you, they join you there.`, `If you ask a direct and honest question, people are made visibly uncomfortable by telling you a lie or hearing one being told.`, `Your finger nails mend and clean the things they scratch, canât break, and are always just the right length for you.`, `You are not truly an Aasimar, just a common human who has deluded themselves into believing they are. Any magical aasimar traits you use are just you subconsciously casting spells.`, ],

DC 15 Wis roll to avoid pouncing on it. `, `A ball of string can put you into a playful trance. DC 15 Wis roll to avoid completely entangling yourself. `, `You tend to stick your tongue out during moments of intense concentration. If interrupted or distracted suddenly when doing this you may forget to put it back in. (a la blep) `, `Draped over a log upside down is the best way to rest around a campfire. No matter how your traveling companions may try to convince you otherwise. `, `You prefer sleeping under the bed, as opposed to in it. `, `Your sworn enemy is a water elemental. They may or may not know about you having made them your nemesis `, `You look perpetually angry or sullen. (Resting grumpy face) `, `If you climb a tree, roll a d4. On a 1, you cannot climb down on your own and need someone to help you. Alternatively you fall out of the tree in a very ungraceful manor `, `You fuss with and groom your tail even chewing on it when nervous (like snow leopards do). `, `When startled you jump (your own body height) straight up. DC 15 Wis roll to consciously avoid jumping. `, `You prefer napping in beams of sunlight `, `When happy you have a tendency to knead things with your paws `, `When you fall you almost always land on your feet (DC10 Dex save). When you fail it's almost always stupidly comical, after which you pretend like (you meant to do that or it never happened) `, `When angry or scared your fur stand on end. This makes you look slightly bigger and a lot fuzzier. `, `You have the irresistible urges to knock things off shelves. It tends to rear its head at the worst times. `, `You prefer to groom yourself with your tongue over a "proper" bath. This can lead to a few awkward moments with other party members. `, `When you are comfortable you emit a low purring sound, especially when sleeping or talking to a person you care about. It can be heard up to 5ft away from you. `, `Your fur is more wiry or frizzled with crinkled whiskers.`, `Your voice is deeper with a rumbling gravelly tone. When you are angry it turns into a growling.`, `You have a great love of fish and seafood.`, `You knock over cups. `, `Naturally nocturnal you are sleepy most of the day and tend to nap a lot.`, `You can let out an impressive roar.`, `Instead of purring you make a rumbling chuffing sound.`, `You actually like swimming and are pretty good at it. With DM Permission you may change out your climbing speed for a swim speed. (Jaguar)`, `Your singing voice is very sharp, piercing, and yowling in nature. To non catfolk it can be grating but to catfolk it is an excellent singing voice.`, `You love cat puns and like to work them into your speech.`, `Your legs are smaller and stockier than average, giving you increased jump height at the expense of actual height. `, `Extreme ankle flexibility, allowing you to climb down trees head-first if so desired, alongside being able to manuever over difficult terrain somehow gracefully. `, `You posess the ability to purr, and can do so whenever you please. Gives Charisma +1 and unique dialogue. `, `Your paw pads are broad and thick, allowing you to easily scale uneven or sharp terrain and absorb the impact of large falls. With DM Permission you get advantage when climbing or going over rough terrain. `, `Small animals fill you with primal energy, and you must make a WIS save or risk pouncing on and/or eating the animal. Lets hope it wasn't someone's pet. `, `Your spine is very flexible, but this also makes it prone to breaking when put under stress. Thus, if someone picks you up you instantly go limp to protect your spine, often shocking the person into thinking they hurt you. `, `Your love of water is a bit much, especially to your party members. Every time you see a body of water, no matter how big or small, you want to race to it, and they often have to physically restrain you. `, `Annoyingly enough, you are very territorial. You have gotten better at sharing, BUT that log is YOUR log. You can't believe [party member] sat on YOUR log.. you've ALWAYS sat on that log when the party sets up camp... (I.e., you "claim" things/areas as your own and get very stubborn and defensive when questioned.) `, `You sleep with one eye open, or wake at the smallest of sounds. Either way, you generally notice if there is an intruder trying to attack at night, but you are a bit tired during the day and take any opportunity to sleep peacefully. `, `Although your senses are enhanced, this isn't always a good thing. Chemicals and gas hurt you more than the other party members, so even if you can warn them before hand, if you are in any situation where you are stuck with said chemicals/gas (like stuck in a burning house) you suffer extra damage. `, `You can't resist crunchy vegetables, you just love to munch and crunch on them. As a result, you are very susceptible to bribes of such treats, and since they are generally of little monetary value it would be easy for someone to take advantage of this. At least your party members enjoy seeing you get so excited at something so small and easily attainable. `, `You are red-green colorblind. This makes it harder to tell if something a merchant is selling is real or fake. Your clothes are also often mis-matched, causing others to assume things about you, for better (like thinking you're cool) or worse (thinking you're dim-witted or lazy). `, `You have a strong urge to eat raw eggs or any raw meat you can get your paws on. However, you have no resistance to food poisoning. `, `You love shiny or otherwise unusual trinkets, from gemstones to the paper inside of a fortune cookie (whether that fortune cookie was yours or not). Your impulse control is meh, and so you often waste storage space with random trinkets/trash. But hey, it may come in handy in the future. Someone else may also see the value of it like you do. `, ],

If their skin is pale, their hair is jet black.`, `Dark elf names are commonly names from other elf races, only reversed.`, `On a full moon, dark elves become incredibly powerful and almost unstoppable. However, they donât usually use this power for anything.`, `Enough Dark Elves have sunlight allergies that their mythos often features them being cursed by the bright, which turns into them being sheltered and embraced by the dark.`, `Secret Heretic Cabalism is rampant and also a very common cause of internecine conflict. For some reason Dark Elves are heavily targetted by Demons for cult building. Conversely Dark Elves have a strong history with very practical experience in building Demon Cults. This seems to be a feedback loop, because the more they are chosen, the better developed become their skills in leading a fanatic group, which is more of an incentive for a Demon Lord to favor them.`, `Dark Elves noblewomen may choose to breed with Svirfneblin slaves to create Half-Elf offspring with some unique abilities. These are smaller as infants allowing easier births, and are much easier to raise than a Dark Elf child. For their Dark Elf mother, and any older siblings, the half-elf child tends to be gnomishly loyal, supportive, and deferential. These children never inherit or challenge their parent or siblings for power. This also makes them less threatening to other highly ranked nobles. The risk of elf children being assassinated, sacrificed, tainted and or transfigured can precipitate a choice to breed such a Half-Elf. These half-elf children are very useful agents, magic users, or warriors, and also they are often talented crafters creating valuable resources. The father will also feel bound by the child to the mother in such an embarrassingly deep degree, that they are often traded away, or "freed" and sent away on missions. In many cases they are sent to breed some other Dark Elf noble women. Nine such half-elves born of nobles from different houses spread over six dark-elf strongholds and cities found out they all had the same father in one such case.`, `Tiefling children of a Dark Elf mother are typically raised by cultists, and born as a gift to the cult. Tiefling children of a male Dark Elf are often raised by their father.`, `There are a number of decadent cults with themed specialist spells that would be considered pointless and trivial by most magic users, but could also be amusing or grotesque. Among Lust cults for example, you might see a transference spell that targets tissues that are only significant in symbolic morale terms, thereby making a servant Priestess or Priests lewdly exposed flesh grow and become more prominent by the shrivelling of their opponents organs. This can lead to some ridiculous deliberate overgrowth by these clergy. Beast cults might grow fangs and teeth similarly. A magic cult might steal fingers, limbs, eyes, and mouths/voices, or brains.`, `Their flesh is made of a strange, black rubbery material, much like that of an octopus or squid.`, `They do not have hair, instead, colored tentacles erupt from their head.`, `Their skin is remarkably similar to candle-wax. They seem to melt if exposed to sunlight or warm heat.`, `Dark Elves are strangely thin. They look like someone stretched skin over bone. Regardless of how thin they grow, they're unnaturally resilient.`, `Dark Elves are surprisingly plump. A wide variety of underground fauna keeps them well-fed. Regardless of how fat they grow, they remain unnaturally nimble.`, `Dark elves have unnaturally sharp teeth, like those of a shark. If they're broken or removed, the teeth grow back in a matter of days.`, `Dark elves eyes glow when exposed to light.`, `Dark elves have cat eyes.`, `Dark elves lack ears. Instead, they have strange drums on the sides of their heads.`, `They can warg into swarm of insects.`, `They come from the Dark side of the moon, their moonship crashed, survivors who escaped are looking for it.`, `Thay share a kind of collective intelligence, having partial access to knowledge and memory of one another at short range.`, `Their eyes and teeth are starck, shiny black.`, `They can feel vibrations in the ground to the point of feeling roots moving, animals etc and tracking people through the faint tremor of their steps. Only Wood elves and halflings are untraceable.`, `Their nails grow quickly, and must be trimmed every week or cause problems when handling objects. They also wear wrapped rags on their feet, rather than socks, for the same reason.`, `Their freckles are bioluminescent`, `Their blood has a strong, sweet smell, like spilled wine`, `They have a stronger grip than you would guess from their arms.`, `Their hair is very fine like spider silk. Their hair even becomes somewhat sticky if not washed properly`, `Their saliva acts as a very mild venom.`, `Portions of their body are covered in chitin.`, `Their hands and feet have tiny hairs that allow for a better grip when climbing (think toby McGuire spider man).`, `They don't blink.`, `Their skin is actually iridescent.`, `They are resistant to spider venom.`, ],

Bul'tar once was the mightiest of the ancient Barbarians and was revered far and wide as the strongest living being. He had wrestled Storm Giants to the ground, broken the neck of the great red wyrm Ixenvhir with his bare hands and sundered mountains with his greataxe. One day, the powerful Lich Acererak took notice of Bul'tar and made a bet with him. If Bul'tar could defeat all of his minions, Acererak would grant him unimaginable riches and treasure if not, Bul'tar would join his army of undead and guard Acereraks tomb for eternity. Bul'tar, confident in his might, agreed. Acererak then continued to summon his minions to fight the barbarian in a battle that would last an entire month and change the landscape forever. Mountains shattered, Earth became barren and everything within hundreds of miles was ground to dust. Bul'tar fought with every ounce of his almost inexhaustible strenght but alas, at the end he was overrun by the endless stream of undead and died, standing in a field filled with streams of his blood and the white powdered bones of millions of undead. Acererak, having won the bet, was nontheless impressed by this display of strenght and fashioned a Statue of Bul'tar out of the undead he had slain and his blood at the place he stood, before taking the corpse away and using it to create one of the mightiest protectors of his true tomb. The Immortal King is still remembered to this day, even if no flesh coils around his adamantine-like bones and his greataxe has set the rust of millenia.", "The Trenchmire Tales: stories told to young, inexperienced potential soldiers about the dangers of siege warfare. It's a cautionary tale regarding common illnesses and afflictions that befall entrenched soldiers and through the use of metaphor, how to treat them successfully .", "Alatat of the Hoard: an old story told while camping on the roads, it's designed to keep its listeners awake through fear and youthful paranoia; highlights of it include staying silent and observant, obeying parental figures and the value of never talking to strangers", "Ten Times Ten Storms: a delightful ballad sang to sleepless children of several races, designed to be whispered quieter and quieter as the verses progress.", "Stirring Bread: a nonsensical tune about preparing baked goods, containing a given family recipe for a specific type of bread; every family has at least one variant of the song memorized and it tends to follow the same general theme from family to family.", "Swords of My Father, Spears of My Mother: a song about being cautious when discussing war and military life with strangers and older family members; could be construed as a way to cope with PTSD for returning veterans - every version has a happy ending ... though the original reportedly does not.", "Quieter Than Sand: a marching song for nomadic tribes of the desert, it's a hummed ditty with only a few spoken words, each one spaced approximately a half hour apart; it instills a sense of time and cadence into young tribe members, a lesson that can sometimes be discerned later in life.", "The Step Worm: When little boys and girls get out of their beds at night, the step worm is underground and can hear the footsteps and little pitter patters. They creep up and burrow in their feet and their feet need to be cut off.", "Auntie Agatha: In a part of my world, there was an old Hag who called herself Auntie Agatha, who would go around at night or in dark/hard to see parts of the woods and whistle to attract children. As the children got close to her, sheâd enter her full size and put them into a big woven backpack and carry them back to her lair to do as she pleases. One party that I ran for killed her after noticing her kidnap a child that had been playing in a field.", "Kindness: This is more of a common set of myths of Gods coming down to the Material Plane and disguising themselves as random (often poor, crazy, or sick folks) people or animals in order to get to know people first hand. If people mistreat them, then they curse them or damn them. If they are treated well, they give Boons to the people, maybe by giving them special treatment in the afterlife, leaving gold and other gifts in places for them to âfindâ, making them just lucky or flat out intervening on their behalf. The God May also get more personally involved, designating that person and their bloodline as destined for greatness (maybe making them Aasimar, or a like of Clerics, Paladins, Sorcerers, and Warlocks). The stories vary by God, culture, region, etc. but they typically have the same common moral of being kind to random strangers (and really just everyone, including animals) in order to appease the Gods. This also actually happens, so sometimes a random villager may find a pot of gold after sharing bread, ale, and food stories with a weary traveler, or a party member may find themselves blessed after tossing a pouch of the dragonâs gold to that homeless child.", "The Forgotten Heroine: Long ago, an immense titan of Elemental Earth was corrupted by the Hells to be an infernal war machine, a hellish continent that would be the start of Hell on Earth. Itâs presence would corrupt the nearby lands with Hellâs influence, but a group of strangers, divided by creed, occupation, background, and just about everything else, worked together to stop them. Their names have been lost to history, but their actions remembered. The strongest among them cleaved valleys in the Titans. The magician bound the titan in place, as if it were a continent. Both of them gave their lives in the process. But finally, the titan had to be subdued, the infection of the Hells driven from its vessel, so the bravest of the heroes, a mortal touched by the divine (though some scholars think her some once divine being fallen from grace), who plunged her blade into the titan and used it as a conduit to channel all of the divinity her mortal vessel could handle and through her and her blade the power flowed into the titan, destroying it and the Hellish infection and leaving behind a now barren continent. The Heroine herself was destroyed. In destroying the titan, she channeled so much of the power of the Gods that she became one with it (sort of akin to the Flash losing himself in the Speed Force should he go to fast), and she is now dispersed throughout the Positive Energy plane, living on as immortal divine power. The last of the strangers, a wise man attuned to the Natural World, took care of the continent and nourished it, allowing it to grow and flourish. No one remembers which of the continents it was, but legend says that a mortal, pure and brave of heart like the heroine of old, may find her blade still buried in the Earth, itâs hilt sticking out and beckoning them like a beacon.",

        "Forestâs Edge â This small town lies on the very edge of the forest and was meant to be a means of restocking before taking a trip into the deep woods. Over the past couple of weeks, people have been mysteriously vanishing from town. When the mayor one day vanished, the town went into a panic. Something evil is stealing the villagers and taking them into the woods.", "The Pit â The town is built around a pit at its center, which is at least 50 feet wide but with an unknown depth. The current residents have not attempted to mine, excavate, or even explore the pit, so they donât know why this location was chosen to build when the town was founded.", "Shellfish Bay â a small fishing village on the edge of an untamed wilderness. Itâs a picturesque place â blue ocean, sand beach, up against dark trees and thick undergrowth, but travellers and adventurers frequently avoid it due to its reputation. Some curse affects the inhabitants â they are slow-witted and short-lived, rarely living past their 30s, and everyone who lives there is affected by it after a time. Many people have tried to help the cursed village, but theyâve all missed the true, mundane cause â mercury buildup from their steady diet of shellfish, and lead poisoning in the water.", "Andrea Gail â A small desert community built around a shipwreck. No one seems to know how the ship got here. Legend says that t was caught in a giant storm that lifted it out of the sea. Others say it was a giant wave. Either way the original sailors had obviously angered some god. Many people live inside of the ship, including the mayor who lives in the former captainâs quarters. There are also some tents and makeshift shelters around the ship.", "Icefark â A relatively small city, cursed with eternal winter and dark skies. The inhabitants are pretty chill, though itâs known that the government is always spying on them, and keeps making problematic people disappear.", "Trigemnlow â A city with two floors â one above the surface and one below. There is no distinction between the floors, though most houses are underground and most businesses are in the surface. Itâs almost always cloudy, because of the big cloud above the city that never goes away. Inhabitants joke about it housing a secret sky floor.", "Mournstead â A large wizard tower stands prominent and ominous protecting its citizens by absorbing all magic spells cast within itâs walls. No one has seen the administrator of the towerâ¦ ever.", "The Reservoir â Not much is known of the ancient precursor civilization that built the massive structure that now dams the river. The lasting and resilient design has provided shelter for the residents that now fill its ancient halls.", "Karathimeth â Far to the north, a group of nomads discovered a massive quartz crystal that provided warmth all year round. This geothermal wonder and the fertile soil surrounding it has provided food and protection against the cold and barren surroundings for generation.", "The Blooming Truffle â once just the Inn the town gets its name fromâ¦. now a bustling border town between the surface and the Underdark.", "The Wormâs Burial â 10 years ago, a heroic group of adventurers slew a massive Purple Worm. A decade later, itâs flesh still fills the storerooms and feeds the people of the community that grew around it. Itâs armor has been repurposed as a building material, leading to the unique architecture seen nowhere else in the world.", "Longstreet â One of the earliest towns constructed with the support of The Human Confederacy in the New World. Named for its long main road that cuts the town in half, and acts as a bulwark between the civilized human lands and the savage Orc Natives. Unknown to the townsfolk, Longstreet sits close to a cache of ancient wonders of a bygone age.", "Talâ Vellar (Skyhold): Long ago, a clan of dwarves were forced into exile from their homes and forced to wander the surface, searching for a new home. A young Noble of the house found and rescued a wounded griffon, which (the legends say) carried him back to the griffon aerie, high up on the cliffs of Mount Targud. There the Dwarf found a series of shallow caves. He returned and led his clan back up the cliffs and established TalâVellar. Clan Norkaidrumm, the Cloud-Tamers, all descend from this clan. TalâVellar is all but inaccessible to uninvited guests. Those who approach from the ground must make their way up perilous, winding trails with steep ascents; those coming from the sky must find their way through the thick clouds surrounding it. More dangerous still are the clanâs halberdier guards, who ride their griffon mounts with unparalleled skill. Anyone who is allowed in, however, discovers the wonder of the Caves Above The Clouds. Perhaps most notable in this is the Sunforge, a large crystal carefully positioned and enchanted so as to catch solar rays and focus them down for forging. Powerful magic weapons are made here (even rarer are the Lunarforged items, possible to work only during a full moon). The Cloud Dwarves, for their part, are strange mirrors of their earthbound cousins, notable for their light-blue eyes and fair skin and hair. Although standoffish and isolationist, the clan can be roused to assist in helping those below, and may sometimes be seen serving as aerial mercenaries for good-aligned armies.", "The Scaffolds â When the great Sorcerer-King Atravarius attempted-and failed-his quest towards deification, his empire crumbled and was destroyed in a single night and day. One of the few remaining remnants was the colossal bronze statue he was having built of himself in his capital of Atravia; standing over 400 feet tall, the great statue represented the might of Atravarius. The unfinished statue miraculously survived the Great Upheaval, even as the great city around it simultaneously burned and drowned. Many of the workers sought refuge in the scaffolding scattered around the statue; as most other buildings were smashed to rubble, they remained there, building living spaces in the labyrinth of rooms inside the statue and establishing a society safe from the wandering monsters and marauders. A large of contingent of the workers had been Kenku, and they took naturally to living in the ramshackle scaffolds, precariously set high in the air. Today, the Scaffolds are a warren of closely packed buildings and thin walkways, surrounding the bronze skeleton of a long-dead king. While many of the original denizens have moved to other cities, the city remains a common retreat for those seeking shelter, or to disappear.", "Potabello â This serene halfling town is built on top of an impossibly large lily pad; the pad covers a good two thirds of the lake it is on. Three bridges connect Potabello to the shore, and the townâs denizens happily fish for giant tadpoles off the edges. No one has seen a giant frog there in fifty years, so where the tadpoles come from- and where they go if not caught- is somewhat of a mysteryâ¦", "Lantern â A small town buried deep in the forest. It might seem odd to name a town after a lantern but it is well earned. Due to the surrounding hills and forest growth, the town practically never sees any direct sunlight. Early settlers created hundreds of magical lanterns that continuously cast Dancing Lights, giving the town streets an enchanting look at all hours. A small river winds its way through the town to help give its residents natural water and resources. The river adds to the lovely view as it reflects the lights.", "Cliffwatch â the only village on the Island of Whispered Regrets, Cliffwatch is all but invisible when approached by land. The deeply overhanging cliffs that give the village itâs name are also host to a forest of enormous trees. Their incredibly dense roots, enhanced with some judiciously applied elvish magic, have allowed the village to form on the underside of the cliffs. While there are secret routes from the village to the top of the island, almost all visitors arrive by sea, sailing into the well-sheltered harbor that sits directly below Cliffwatch. At night, the bridges and windows of the village shine brightly, though they are eclipsed easily by the powerful Cliffwatch Beacon, a magically fueled lighthouse built into the end of the longest taproot of the trees above.", "Fungosillo â A small, seemingly friendly oasis town in the middle of the desert where cooking, eating or damaging a small, unassuming and common brown mushroom with white spots that grows exclusively in the inside of its walls is forbidden and highly penalizedâ¦ in secret. The reclusive mayor is a puppet of a Cordyceps-like myconid, who acts as a âprotectorâ (more like an extortionist) and keeps the townsfolk sacrifice to a minimum as long as they kidnap the occasional traveler in their sleep and provide them as an offering to the underground fungi colony.", "New Talyport â a magical city, which require outsiders to fulfill one requirement for entrance. A magic item will cut off their left hands and preserve them in jars. The hands can easily be reattached later but if the city guard sees you committing a crime the hands are pricked with poison, kill the evildoer in a matter of hours.", "Bogsburrough â A town built in a swamp to avoid larger cities or governments. A place where many of the valued illegal goods in the area are made, such as potent poisons, meats of endangered species, addictive substances, and many other kinds of items treasured by outlaws.", "Mirage â This town, built on natural formations of the broken walls of a canyon has a particularity that makes it stand out from most caverns, natural occurring or crafted: the outer walls of all buildings and a grand open air spiral staircase that connects many levels are of a thick, semi-transparent polished quartz.", "Skum â While the townâs true name was Skaâaum, a word that meant temporary haven, over the years it has come to earn the bastardized version of its name. A place populated by bandits and thieves, killers and assassins, Skum has one, ironclad law; never deal your fellow residents raw. Allegiance to that single rule makes the town, if not peaceful, a place that is much safer than its reputation would suggest. Unless, that is, someoneâs coming to the town with a writ, or a badge. Those things will get you strung up at the crossroads as an example to other do-gooders and bounty hunters that Skum is not a place for them.",
        "Maraboâor â A fairly new coastal town of half-constructed houses with canvas and net walls and roofs, sandy roads, and an overall feel of growth. The townâs known for being a rising shipping hub, built at an ideal local between two trade hotspots. A renovated and remodeled shipwreck in the center of town serves as the town hall, where each of the 12 districts (specializing in different products/purposes) sends representatives to make laws. However, tensions rise between the districts when a threat to the town is fast approaching. Will the fledgling Maraboâor survive this, or collapse into anarchy?", "The Crannogs: A series of artificial islands in a shallow lake, known for its abundant freshwater clam beds prized as delicacies. Both bridges and canals connect the numerous small islands. The old families are often in dispute over each other and bridges have been known to be taken down and reassembled elsewhere to make a point about shifting alliances. Lately the clam yields have been dropping despite no changes to the collecting methods. At the same time, the clam rakes have begun to bring up bones and old rusty bits of armor and weapons with strange runes. A digger known to be a strong swimmer was observed being sucked underwater after he went in the lake to retrieve a dropped tool.", "Savlok â A town built suspended underneath a large natural stone arch. The upper class live in towers built up the suspension system of the town. The townâs poor live in hovels 200ft down below on the ground floor where waste and broken things are tossed carelessly.", "Webrock Canyon- this town sits on stone bridges connecting one cliffâs edge to another. These bridges are little more than errant strips of stone that, when viewed from above look like a spider web. The brave souls that live here live on platforms suspended over the cavern and connected by rope bridges. Most of them make a living by ferrying items across the canyon, but others collect water and fish from the bottom of the canyon by suspending buckets from rope. Others still try to mine from the sides of the mountain, but there is a debate going on as to whether or not this could endanger the town.", "Camanchaca â this town is situated on the bottom side of a cloud, and has a reverse gravity enchantment on it. The people that live there live in ice huts and farm moisture from the cloud cover. They send traders repelling down into the deserts below in order to sell water for consumption and agriculture", "Draelesh â A town situated right on the barrier to the ethereal plane. The townsfolk live alongside spirits like neighbors and see them much in the same way common folk see stray cats. Many of them also have an understanding of divination and history not seen outside of universities due to their extensive experience with spirits.", "The City of Whistling Glass- this town sits in what used to be Thri-Keen tunnels before a blue dragon electrified their lair for offending her. When she dragged out the remains, it looked like limbs of a great glass tree. A gnomish town now sits in its âshadeâ. When the desert breeze reaches itâs trunk it makes a dull whistle that gives the town itâs namesake. The townspeople use the reflected light of the sun in order to create charged, radiant lanterns that they use as batteries.", "Saltpoint â A seaside village complete with a large set of docks and lots of fisherman. The townsfolk are quite paranoid about the woods to the north and refuse to get any resources from there. They get all they need from the sea. (The buildings are all scrapped together with driftwood or parts of boats).", "Crowâs Nest â A village on an island built entirely in the guts of a very large and very ruined ship. The âLower Decksâ house the lower echelons of society and the wealth grows as you go up the wooden structure of the boat. The elite are found enjoying the sun on the parts of the deck that are still intact. A roof has been built over the large crowâs nest that dominates the structure and it houses the leader of the community.", "Brightshade â This town is built right on top of the tomb of a sleeping beholder. None of the townsfolk are aware of the tomb but the beholderâs dreams create all kinds of strange magical phenomena. Disappearances are so common they arenât even investigated anymore.", "Shiverton â In this frontier silver mining town, every building is built on stilts so that they arenât rattled apart by the frequent minor earthquakes that take place in this area. A white dragon protects the town from bandits and barbarians but demands silver from the mines as payment. Even as the mines become more dangerous, the work most not slow down, lest they incur the white dragonâs wrath.", "Aurumdale â A town on the edge of a desert and at the base of a mountain with a gold mine in it. An aqueduct extends from the mountain into the town supplying it with water. It is widely known that this town is under the control and protection of an ancient blue dragon that lairs deeper in the desert. The town pays the dragon a tax of 1 gold piece or equivalent goods per person every year. The dragon plays the long game to slowly build its treasure hoard and is known to extend leniency on its taxes for exceptional additions to its hoard. The town is currently in its last month of a tax-free decade after someone turned in a Dragon-Slayer sword.", "Flotsam â This city resides within an absolutely massive metal ship that rests in the middle of a bay. The lower decks are submerged, but the upper decks are habitable and hotly contested realty. The means of operating the ship and any weapon systems it may have had are long lost, but a strange phenomena attracts debris to the ship. A field of floating scrap metal, debris, and garbage surrounds the ship for a few miles. The field is thick enough to walk on within a few miles, but hazardous with occasional thin spots and sharp debris. Within the immediate vicinity of the ship the debris is thick enough that some have been able to construct structures on it, making a shantytown.", "Lobersmuth â A town built by criminals for criminals, it sits on the edge of a swamp. No building has a name on the outside, and the streets are deliberately labyrinthine. Any who look lost or ask for directions are immediately marked as outsiders and potential targets.", "Maurkin â A town in the midst of a great and vast dark wood, the quaint town of Maurkin is under the rule of Night Prophetess Damis. She has taught the people necromancy, allowing them to stay inside and study while the undead help work the fields. Special care is given to keep the streets vermin-free, and the people will take special interest in people who have corpses to give, as spare bodies tend to be hard to come by. The Night Prophetess Damis is actually a middling necromancer named Chrysanthemum. Sheâs a good person at heart, and a possible love interest if the PCs are cool with dating the effective ruler of a town of necromancers.", "The prison fortress of Hollow Hands lies in a tucked away valley where the weave of magic does not touch the world. This fortress is home to the powerful mages that have become enemies of the empire. Despite the menacing presence of the fortress, the townâs unique anti-magic property has attracted an interesting crowd of locals, many of who believe that they have a âMagic Allergyâ and moved here for the sake of their health.", "Tranca â Small port trade city ran by Jerrod the One-eyed. He runs the town with ruthless efficiency, but he never overstepped in tyranny. As with all ports, you see various folk on the streets and in the docks, as well as variety of goods. The town is home to Sapphire Masters, a group of smiths, and undergraduate wizards who discovered how to infuse steel with some level of magic, making them only ones in the realm who can reliably create +1 weapons and armor.", "Domos Negros â A village of farmers in the middle of a desert plateau, who obtain water for their crops by absorbing the humidity of the mist that forms at night through the material from which their constructions are made: some domes of the darkest black one can imagine.", "Old Hallows â This city was built by a group of adventures over the site of a Vampiric cultâs unholy cathedral. Legends foretold the return of the cultâs powerful Vampire leader, the terrible Sarrâgethal Moncreft. The adventurers swore that they and their descendants after them would serve as guardians against Moncreftâs return. As such, the city is built with great layers of hallowing mixed into the very foundation. The streets are crafted from marble and laid out in holy sigils; the dead are cremated, their ashes blessed and spread in the Field of Martyrs. Powerful white walls surround the city, with fields of fire shaped into the earth to provide for protection from attack. The careful preparation led to Moncreftâs return being one of the most anticlimactic events of the age; no sooner did his spirit congeal into the material plane then he was trapped in a divine forcecage, separated into three parts, and sealed into three different airtight casks filled with holy water. One cask remains stored in the Old Hallows museum; the other two have been hidden. The cityâs primary task completed, it now stands as a bastion of good and a source of great heroes.", "Syomâskit-Ngthefl â Legend says that this gnomish town was purposefully named to be difficult to pronounce, so that outsiders would feel unwelcome. True or not, the gnomes of the area tend to be gruff and standoffish, with seemingly little interest in trade or news of the outside world. How such a place continues to thrive is a mystery.", "The Grinders â A human city built atop a Dwarven guard post, The Grinders is situated to defend Fourwater Pass against Orcish invasion from the Hungry Wilds. Prospering due to its location, the city is increasingly fat, corrupt, and poorly defended, depending on its impressive walls and its history of success. The Orcish hordes have been relatively silent in the last three decades; recently, however, there have been more and more incursions, with signs of a more unified force behind them. Rumor has it that the city is still protected by incredible Dwarven traps and defenses; however, the nearby Dwarven stronghold of Kryâthish has been increasingly cool to their human neighbors, taking a poor view of the local government. As a great invasion seems increasingly imminent, the help of the Dwarves may become vital to the cityâs survivalâ¦",
        "Nahppa â A town located on two levels, straddling the great Nah Falls. The fish caught in the falls are a local delicacy, famous for their bright purple color. The locals love to tell fishing stories; however, the nature of the falls actually makes fishing relatively simple.", "The City of Quiet- Founded as a home for the deaf of the Elven Mochâarinin peoples, Quiet is located on top of a hill with a great view out onto the ocean. Although there is a number of non-deaf now living there, the city is still mostly silent, with communication via hand-signs.", "Gauthflame- a town nestled next to a series of craggy hills, Gauthflame is ruled over by Zybaxtrees, a copper dragon masquerading as a red one. Zybaxtrees receives a relatively lenient tax from the local residents, and protects the town from threats. He has been carrying on the masquerade for generations, partly for protective purposes, partly as a long-term prank. He finds himself very clever, and isnât overly anxious to not be found out by adventurers; however, he makes them promise not to tell the townsfolk.", "Weneelomi â This small town lies on the outskirts of a much larger Elven university. Here, buildings are constructed to test the elvesâ latest architectural styles. As a result, the various styles all at once can be overwhelming for new visitors.", "Elysia â This ice town is located in the middle of a desert where ice never melts. An old frost giant artifact holds it together.", "Dunclaver â This old logging town is run by dwarves located on the edge of Growers Forest. The forest magically grows back every week what the loggers cut, no one knows how or why but if not cut back the forest slowly creeps into the town.", "Clanoothyn â this small town clings to the precarious slopes of a valley, its buildings straggling along a rough winding road that follows the edge of a vast lake. A century before, Clanoothyn was a bustling farming community surrounding the river on the fertile valley floor, but a century ago, an unknown disaster in the mines caused a vast landslide: the entire north side of the valley slipped down and blocked the valley gorge so that bit by bit the valley flooded. Today, the only remnant of Old Clanoothyn is the topmost story of the old Wizardâs Tower still jutting defiantly upwards from beneath the waters.", "Rooskey â A small human settlement on the borders of the Night Forest; always surprisingly cold. The people there open their homes to visitors; it is customary to leave money or something of value in response, but it is rude to speak of pricing.", "Bricabrac- No one is sure where the portal comes from. Floating some 45 feet above the ground, the large floating rift opens periodically, emptying the contents onto the pile below. It seems likely that the society on the other side of the portal is highly magically advanced, and using the portal as a garbage disposal- although the leavings are a pile of detritus, enough magic items and valuable effects come through the portal to allow the denizens of the nearby town of Bricabrac to make a living scavenging through the junk. The process is not without peril, however; not only are there natural dangers and thrown-away traps, but sometimes the things being thrown away are still aliveâ¦", "Dismal Hollow â A small village located in a swamp, in which the buildings and walkways are built atop stilts so the structures sit just atop the water. The town is home to a small handful of humans and was originally settled as a military outpost. To the west, where the swamp meets the edge of a sacred forest, a tribe of wood elves protect the edge of their forest home from outsiders and are not happy that Dismal Hollow grows in size and population every year. However, both the humans and the elves have a centipede demon and its bug demon children to worry about as the demons devour everything in their path and is quickly bearing down on both civilizations.", "Louchitaine â a large town built in a gigantic mangrove forest. Warm, humid, and wonderfully fragrant, Louchitaine exists in a sun dappled twilight even on the brightest of itâs tropical days. The town is a hub for travellers passing by, as well as a popular tourist and vacation destination. While people of every shape, size, and race can be found there, itâs original denizens are a race of Fruitbat Folk (Generally lawful neutral, stats as Aarakocra with darkvision and an aversion to bright light). They are generally friendly, but almost every member of the Folk knows someone who knows someone who is involved in the organized crime cabals that run the town, or is active in those circles themselves. Louchitaine is a great town to get lost in for a while, but if you wander too far into itâs shadier groves, you might never leave.", "Yojimboq â built on a fortified island not too far off the coast, Yojimboq is known for whaling, unfriendly fisherpersons of every race, face, and creed, and for itâs rats. The islandâs windy hills and craggy landscape has a dense and intractable rat population. Rats the size of cows prowl the landscape, hunting one another for food, fighting for mates and competing for resources and refuges. Smaller rats are everywhere, feasting on washed up seafood, insects, and the occasional unwatched child. Yojimboq has high walls protecting it from the local fauna, but raiding parties go out weekly to keep the overall rat population to almost manageable levels. An open bounty exists for any rat catchers who wish to bring back heads for gold. Their nearest neighbors on the coast (referred to locally and derisively as âCoastiesâ) have no idea why in the gods name people choose to live there. Residents are fiercely protective and proud of their town, and will defend itâs honor from any slight.", "Old Whizzâs Tower â Old Whizzâs Tower is just that â an old wizards tower. At some point in the past, the wizard residing in it must have decided that they wanted to see more of the world, and commanded his tower to travel around from place to place. The tower did so, and floats gently around the continent a height of about 50 feet. Eventually, the wizard either passed on or moved out, but the tower still wanders around. Enterprising individuals determined that objects lashed to the tower would also levitate, so long as they were properly attached. A shanty town has been cobbled together, with the old tower at itâs core, providing both levitation and an uncanny amount of foundational support for the wandering town. Shops, a tavern, and a hotel are the main features, with a town hall being held occasionally in the old tower itself. Whenever Old Whizzâs Tower encounters an obstacle of any real size, it will float gently out of the way, though punters (think towns guard with extensible enchanted polls) will occasionally help it on itâs way, or steer it in a more favorable direction.", "Menagerie â Once, ages ago, an old queen lived in a great castle. Her pride and joy was a menagerie, home to wondrous beasts, birds, and all manner of creatures. She loved every one, and would delight in visiting each, and making sure it had a more than adequate habitat to reside in. Eventually the queen passed, and the menagerie continued to be taken care of by her loving family and servants. Over time, others moved near by to visit the site. Some brought families. Eventually, a town grew out of the old castle, taking care of the incredible creatures contained within, and occasionally harvesting food, ingredients and other supplies to sell to other towns or apothecaries. The Menagerie is still active today.", "Daleberg â A small town, named after itâs arrogant and pompous founder, Dale. The townsfolk seem completely normal, but each has chosen to pronounce a different word incorrectly, with the exception of Dale, who is slowly losing their mind. A DC 20 investigation check reveals that this is actually all intentional â a prank by the townsfolk on their insufferably mayor. A fund has been set up to whomever has the most ludicrous mispronunciation of that week, and another, much larger fund has been set up for whomever finally gets Dale to break. The mayor is becoming increasingly ill tempered, and a high enough charisma role after passing the DC 20 investigation check will have the townsfolk invite you to join in on the joke. Fireworks will ensue.", "Craighoof â A halfling settlement that has a symbiotic relationship with the neighboring centaur tribes. They drove off an Orcish invasion ages ago and averted a famine at the same time. Farms and orchards dot the landscape along with tall trees that have difficult to reach fruit. Scouts from each group band together for up to a year to patrol the perimeters.", "Storm Reach â A town built on a plateau in the shadow of a basalt cliff, Storm Reach is high enough to be easily defended from the dangers of the forests below. However, itâs exposed to the raging thunders that circle the peaks, and its walls stand against the high winds that could otherwise sweep one right over the side.", "Umberdale â A town that has been completely taken under control of a mind flayer. It has feasted on their brains and replaced them with an Intellect Devourer. The people act strange and unusual. Elderly farmers are able to carry what looks to be double their weight. Children run stores along with adults and even the pets can be seen as intelligent (walking on back legs, cooking food with fire).", "Afsthenâs Peak â an independent agrarian town situated in one of the least hospitable mountain ranges in the world. The mountain of Afsthen is so tall that a third of it rests comfortably above the clouds at all times, eternally blanketed in snow. Yet a monumental hot spring graces the caldera where its peak should be, and it hosts an island in its northwest with surprisingly fertile soil. Here resides the town. Neighboring kingdoms are unwilling or unable to claim the town, since any army would be worn down by the inhospitable flanks of the mountain range. This suits the insular Afsthenei fine- they have little need for traders and no need for laws made by people theyâve never seen nor heard of. There are less than two thousand Afsthenei, all told, mostly human, but with some immigrants who have fled up the peaks, or immigrated in order to pursue a simpler life. They raise goats and other hardy livestock, as well as a few crops adapted to the rarified air, but at such an altitude they canât grow any trees. For wood, the men of the village descend past the clouds and beneath the tree line during the warmest summer days to spend much of their time logging. The wood is stockpiled in cyclopean warehouses for use the rest of the year.", "Wading Helm â miles out to sea, the top of a titanic humanoidâs head just barely peaks above the waves. Clad in armor, the decomposed remains of this ancient being continue to move, as it walks a somewhat elliptical path across the southern seabed. Wading Helm is a shantytown built atop it, made from imported stones and wood. Tethered boats are dragged behind the titanâs head like hair drifting in the water. Fishing is plentiful, as the movement of the colossus drives up vast clouds of nutrient-rich particles from the seafloor and brings schools of fish. Whaling nets them bone for scrimshawing and other artistic purposes. Wading Helm exports a variety of exotic waxes, soaps, and oils, made by mixing seafloor particulate with tallow and some other secret ingredients. Of course, they also trade away more conventional fish and marine mammal byproducts. Most of its population is away on trading fleets, which may take months to reach their destinations. Due to the shifting location of their homeland, Wadehelmers have honed the ability to read the sky and waves to know where they are.", "Kormaring is an exquisite town. The roads are paved with scintillating glass flagstones. The four soapstone outer walls are painted red to match the leaves of the stripped-bark maples, and the gates are adorned with flowering vines. Fountains at the center of each crossroads in this square-shaped town each hold a large, perfectly reflective, silvery ball about as wide as a manâs chest. The inner walls of each building are lined with pink halite. The city itself has four-fold symmetry, with a large temple dominating its center. The temple, though roofed, remains open to the elements by virtue of not having doors for its wide doorways. The halfling and gnomish citizens ensure the candles at the center altar are lit, and carry out the rituals depicted on carefully preserved banners that used to flutter from the temple arches. But no one knows who originally built the city, or why the modern-day citizens are compelled to carry out the temple rituals.", "Dahruulâs Gate â the center of information commerce for the land, Dahruulâs gate is the largest artificing town around. Built into an ancient basin, it also does commerce with the Underdark, with the local mind flayers being willing to trade information. In addition, it has removed the death penalty in a large area around it. Death is seen as a waste of mind, body, and soul, of which there is a thriving market for all three for various purposes. Dahruulâs also boasts some of the finest medical technology money can buy, as well as a relatively low crime rate. Criminals have become very profitable for the city, as they can sell the person four ways. Alive, as a slave. Their body, as an undead slave or medical specimen, their soul as a power source, and their brain as âflayer food.", "The Bubble â Created to protect an ancient artifact, this city is found on the ocean floor in the crystal clear waters of a bay. The magical tome locked away in the cities vault creates a large bubble in the water, protecting all those inside. The only way into this city is through an underground tunnel that takes you to the edge of the town. While all are welcomed, this city is mostly inhabited by water genasi.", "Hagshead Rock â A small village placed on the edge of a large peat bog. The villagers harvest the stingweed berries that grow in the bog and make a variety of tart jams and jellies, as well as a heady wine. No one knows where the townâs name comes from.", "The Lichus â A bustling trade town located above a group of natural caverns. The town has grown up from nothing within the last 10 years, and has a reputation for great sales and impressive hospitality. This growth is, in fact, due largely to a powerful Otyugh wizard, Mungri, who lives in the caverns below the town and feeds off the offal and refuse from the town and the caravans who frequent it. Mungriâs unusual brilliance has also increased his telepathic range, which allows him to ânudgeâ the residents to improve their work, and visitors to feel welcome.", "Grovelerâs Knob â An impoverished farming village, or at least whatâs left of one. For the past several years, every few months a recurring plague has most of the men in bed with fever and strange orange dots covering their faces and necks. The women arenât affected but theyâre too busy ministering to the ill to tend to the fields. The plague only lasts about a ten-day, and thereâs no lasting effects, but it has the local economy in a tizzy.", "Pali â Built halfway up the side of a deep jungle canyon, Pali offers its citizens protection on two fronts. First, it is difficult for the jungle beasts or other would-be invaders to reach the village without using the well-known â and well-guarded â pathways up the cliff. Second, a massive spider maintains a thick web across the top of the canyon, creating a tricky barrier against any aerial assaults. The spider â which was living here long before Pali was established â doesnât seem to pay any attention to the village, but the remains that drop to the canyon floor when it cleans its web occasionally provide the villagers with some very interesting resources.",
        "Giizlunrik â âDesert Dwarfâs Dark Draught: An Oasis in Each Drop. Brewed in the Town of Giizlunrik.â This ale can only be found in more upscale taverns, so itâs always a welcome surprise to see Desert Dwarfâs sunset logo on a barrel behind the barkeep. Venturing out to the legendary town of Giizlunrik is a journey undertaken by only the most passionate of drink connoisseurs, for it really is in the middle of the desert. Upon arrival, such pilgrims are caught by surprise, as the town seemingly consists of a shack and a signpost reading âCheers, and Welcome to Giizlunrik.â Upon entry to the shack, because what other option is there, it becomes apparent that the town is entirely underground. Whoops. These are dwarves, after all. These dwarves not only make a mean brew, they also give fantastic brewery tours and sell top-grade brewerâs kits! Any and all travelers leave the town grinning, with a sunset-logoed travel flagon attached to their packs.", "Ald Yock- For some inexplicable reason, the denizens of Ald Yock have no knowledge of the outside world. The townsfolk are aware that the outside world exists, of course; however, they show no interest in anything foreign, and quickly forget anyone not a resident of the town. Thus, even someone who comes back again and again every year will be a stranger each time they arrive, with any previous actions attributed to âone of you outsiders.â Unfortunately, this lack of consequence has led many to view the town as a place to act without license; as a result, the townsfolk view visitors with suspicion and distaste.", "Hommshome â Barely more than a hamlet, Hommshome would be beneath notice if it were not for the Matraine family. The Matraines, hardy farming stock, ran into monetary difficulties after a spate of illnesses. In order to aid the family, three of the Matraine sons set out to make a fortune adventuring; within a year, the Matraine Brothers were some of the realmâs greatest heroes, and Hommshome has benefited from the treasure they sent back.", "Thromarch â Formed by The Handmen of The Glorified Chalice, a utopian society. The Handmen believed that a glorified anarcho-socialist form of government was destined to be successful; thus, when the city failed, it failed spectacularly. Thromarch survived the resulting food riots, but has still not recovered from its losses.", "Fangelâs Stacks â A city comprised of mines, forges, and hot air balloons. Originally a mining community, the abundance of coal caused a large number of blacksmiths to move into the residential sections of the mine during itâs early days. With the rapidly expanding population, the smoke and heat eventually became unbearable. As a solution, the Smithâs began boring shafts from the surface down to their smithies. Over time, build up from the smoke formed stalagmite-like columns around the holes, which have to be cleaned regularly to prevent closure. The older the forge, the bigger the stack was. Once their size began to be seem as a symbol of prestige, it was only a matter of time until some smiths began to artificially increase the size of their stacks and label them with crests as a form of advertisement to traders approaching the city. In recent years an enterprising architect and engineer began building a network of hot air balloon structures above the stacks. The heat venting out of the stacks keeps this small aerial district afloat but a few accidents has prevented a large number of people and businesses from moving to the floating latticework of canvas and wood.", "Thrafitt â Originally a penal colony for the large city of Haworthy, Thrafitt is located on an island with large, imposing cliffs about three miles from the mainland. When gold sand was found on Thrafittâs northern shore, it quickly became a boomtown.", "Downwater â bordered on the West by salt flats, Downwater was erected around a cavernous waterhole with no visible floor. The buildings are made mostly of wood, with stonemasonry reserved for the foundations and skeleton of more important buildings. The dusty streets are wide open and salted seasonally to prevent local poisonous plants from growing. Salt scraping and mining provide most of the townâs jobs. The sinkhole used to be filled with drinkable water, but its water level began dropping a few years back and now itâs impossible to see the water line from the surface. A lengthy, rickety pipe system has been constructed to siphon the water up.", "Stag Run â named for the event that helped settlers discover this place, Stag Run is built on a season-sensitive freshwater swamp and is adjacent to multiple small river tributaries. Fruits, nuts, fish, and meat are in abundance, and the town produces a marvelously sweet cheese. Most of Stag Run is protected from visibility due to the thick vegetation and lack of easily identifiable landmarks. However, the poor soil makes farming only possible at the outskirts of the town, in open sight of those traveling the rivers or forest roads. In addition to its cheese, Stag Run is also notable for its âfriendlyâ monkeys and the beautiful pearl vines, whose flowers open in response to moonlight.", "The Ruts â a trade stop built atop the buried remains of an old city. Many of its larger roads were excavated at some point in order to erect storm shelters. Scapegraces and adventurous souls use the uncharted passageways between these ârutsâ to go where they want undetected. Many of the modern structures are made of adobe. The Ruts exports clay pottery and hemp fiber, paint, and paper, as well as sandstone and granite in bulk from its quarries.", "Ahsju â erected on the terraces of a fertile mountain, the ancient Ahsjans used powerful earth-shaping magics to erect mountainside dams. In spite of erosion and gravity, the bowl-shaped structures they created jut out the sides of the mountain today. The waterfalls produced by divots in the dam walls during heavy rains are so long they cast rainbows before hitting the ground. The town itself reveres the dams, and uses these large reservoirs of fresh water to feed their humongous fields.", "Krayax â sheltered from sharp northern winds by cloud-scraping cliffs, Krayax is surrounded on all other sides by sloping chaparral. The land is only good for onion farming and agave harvests, and the nearest river is miles away, so it seems like there would be little reason to found a town here. The citizens receive most of their supplies from wizard consortiums through a magical gate. The town itself is close to a major nexus of leylines, from which its gate draws energy; it is founded atop a vault that contains artifacts of great power and evil, and the Krayaxian people train specialized Honorguard to patrol and protect the vault.", "Sychone â A town where nobody trusts anybody and everyone has their own crackpot conspiracy theories about something or other. Turns out the drinking waterâs got traces of drugs that are known to destroy peoplesâ mental states.", "Higpace â An enormous 50-floor tower that is entirely economically independent. The bottom 15 floors are residential, the next 10 are recreational, the next 10 are industrial and shopping, the next 20 are devoted to farming and supplying food, and the top 5 floors are governmental. Itâs a relatively nice city and itâs surprisingly sturdy, though thereâs only one elevator, so a lot of the time youâll have to use the stairs if you want to go anywhere.", "Driftwood â A completely normal town focused largely on industry. The only strange thing about it is that it floats freely on the surface of a giant lake with nothing to control which direction it goes. Because it has no way of controlling where it is, it is almost impossible to find without the use of magic.", "Troad-mouth â a small mining town known for its unique gems, strange animals, sick populace, and permanently warm soil (town has a lot of radiation, but it hasnât been discovered yet).", "Stormhaven â city built around a mountain, which is permanently covered in clouds of a residing elder tempest, worshipped by all of its citizens. Tempest and Knowledge clerics are the rulers and embodiments of endless power and infinite wisdom of their thunder god. Only the bravest of the warriors who manage to climb the top of the mountain can become members of the elite Order of thunders that protect the nearby realms and that sails the seas, bringing storms and destruction to all enemies, while chanting âwe are the storm!â", "Borgona â At first this town seems completely normal. However, as the players explore, everything seems a little off. The players will gradually get clues as to what is gong on in this town. Every building smells like rotten eggs. The town is too quiet and peaceful. No one owns candles. Many people from out of town inexplicably moved in. Hard to spot Trails of ooze inside the buildings. The residents seem absent minded, only noticing players if they make a noise. If the players try to leave, the residents might insist that they stay, at which point the players will soon realize the town has been taken over by many obliges: a memory eating monster that can create dummies using the memories it has eaten.", "Wave Borough â A beach where a kraken was about to attack, but a wizard who is a master of time-based magic sacrificed themself, freezing them, the kraken, and the tidal wave the kraken summoned, frozen in time. Since the wave is solid, it has the properties of dense stone rather than water, and the city has expanded to build on top of it and the kraken.", "The Bridge â A giant stone archway several miles wide connect the peaks of two mountains, which are both infested with monsters. The entire town is built on the sturdy bridge, with wizards employed to ensure it never collapses.", "Saylen â The elvish word for Starfall. A town in the middle of an open field, but a strange magnetic pull causes shooting stars and other meteorites to be drawn to the surrounding field. Entire guilds race to whenever a new star crashes in order to harness its resources, though the occasional monster will crash as well.", "Towertown â A wizardâs tower thatâs bigger on the inside. The wizard died long ago, but the Kenku he employed still live there. Theyâve been there for generations, creating several family lineages within the giant tower.", "Frogsmarch â This city is built up in the mountains next to what appears to be a frozen swamp. Long ago, a hag named Aunt Biddyboty lived in the swamp, and made a deal with a Frost Giant Jarl that ended very badly. Calling on ancient magics, the Frost Giants wove a powerful spell that transported the swamp, in entirety, high up to its current location, freezing it to the spot immediately. Legends say there are valuables in the marsh, waiting next to monsters still frozen in placeâ¦", "Mecha â This city is the most sacred pilgrimage site for constructs. Constructs whose masters were slain or have developed a consciousness of their own flock to this city for protection, a sense of community, and to pay homage to holy relic in the center of the city. This relic, upon inspection, is a large, silvery comet that had impacted the land centuries ago. It is rumored that some sort of creature lives within it as some claim they have heard noises within it.", "Morvinâs Retreat â Built on a giant stretch of earth that moves ever so slowly across the countryside, Morvinâs Retreat is home to the clan of Hopkipper gnomes, who take delight in designing impractical devices to study the reason for the movement of the city. The stretch of earth moves at a rate of about a mile every two weeks, and moves in a seemingly random direction.", "HoowâCard â A city originally inhabited by Elves, then spoiled by Orcs for generations, then retaken by Humans for generations, then abandoned to Orcs again, then eventually retaken by Humans. As a result, the city is a fascinating mix of different architectures and cultures. The one constant for the city is the Goblin underclass, who live in the poor edges of the city and run a well-established Thievesâ Guild.", "Black Lungâs Bend â An all-human mining town a half a mile above sea level and the nearest seaport. Population: 65. They mine for coal and do intense manual labor. But for some reason, no one is sick. Or old. Or young actually, everyone is exactly 30 years old. And only maleâ¦. and when they get hurt, the go to the deepest parts of the mines and come back healed. Weird.", "Often Island â A small, remote village that semiannually becomes an island due to intense seasonal flooding. 6 months out of the year they are an important supplier of fish for the empire.

A tsunami that almost destroyed the city was frozen in time by the kingâs trusted elven sorcerer. As he has aged, the spell has begun to lose its power and now the wall of water has begun to creep ever closer to the city. The sorcerer has fallen ill and the kingdom seems to be on the verge of destruction.", "Gallomir â a Dwarven village built on a steep cliffside, similar to the Adobe Pueblo settlements in Colorado. The town has a rich tourism industry which has overtaken itâs mining roots, resulting in many abandoned shafts where creepy crawlies lurk, and somewhat depressed ex-miners who hate their jobs as tour guides, gift shop workers, etc. The town mayor, Pratten, leads in a state of turmoil as many rebel against the tourism industry in favor of returning to itâs industrial glory days.", "BevaâRahj â A town for performers retirement. This place is where the bards, dancers, poets, opera singers, and everything in between comes when itâs their time to lay down the dancing shoes, quills, instruments, or costumes.

        "âThe Shortening of Meradian Finnâ â A Dwarven drinking song with thirty-eight official verses (and countless unofficial ones), the song recounts the punishment meted out against an Elven noble who stole from a Dwarven treasury. The chorus ends with a rousing slamming of glasses and a âin the end, he never did again!â It is considered poor taste by many elves, which helps account in part for its popularity.", "âThe Bawdy Body of Biddy Badeeâ â A raucous account of an old woman accidentally restored to youth and beauty.

Each time the chorus is sung, Hamishâs name is lengthened with more titles (the last chorus includes as many silly titles as the singer can think of and can sing in a single breath) followed by âbut you can just call me the Gnome!â Although believed to be human in origin, gnomes love the song, and an informal competition has sprung up as to the longest final chorus. The current record belongs to Sprigvill Gaudynack, who (via both her own talent and magical augmentation) kept the last chorus going for three and a half minutes.", "âCallaudâs Pre-funeral Danceâ â A sprightly instrumental air for country dances. If played with a performance check DC 18 or higher, it functions like âOttoâs Irresistible Danceâ for anyone not in combat or threatened (i.e. it will make listening townsfolk break out into dance, but not if you are in the midst of robbing their homes).", "âLong, Gone Galangalâ â A love story told through Gamelan music about an adventurous Chef seeking a rare root in the forest.

It devours an entire town, where every occupant, their occupation, their children, and the name of their family pets are listed. At first no-one stops it because they are too self-centered. In the end, the townâs guards and even the mayor are devoured.

That adventurous bard made it back to the surface, but not understanding the dialect of the deep, transposed the lullaby into a few other chords and added an improvisational lick of their own. That was a thousand years ago, and people have been humming and playing the tune up here ever since then, 50 generations later.", "âHealth Potion #9â â A song about a long-suffering herbalist companion to a luckless knight and the scrapes the two of them get into.

Excluding the alchemical ingredients, such as the eyes or heart (which must always be consumed raw if used in magical recipes or rituals), most of a dragon is meat, just like any animal. After the arduous task of scaling (best done with the beasts own claws or teeth), the meat must be cooked on an incredibly hot flame, regardless of species. It is believed to be physically impossible to overlook dragon. Also, the dragons tongue is entirely edible. Often considered an alchemical ingredient, it can be cooked or dried into jerky.

This dished is traditionally served in a family style fashion by dumping in a large pile on a table and dumping additional spices directly on top.", "Fondgoo: An insane eccentric aspiring gourmet turned adventurer developed this after a horrific adventure in a ooze laboratory. Combining the jelly of a gelatinous cube with copious amounts of cheese and wine over high heat, you are able to neutralize most of the acidic elements to create an amazing dish. A mild anesthetizing effect tickles and numbs the mouth, preventing speech for a minute after consumption. Some consider this a boon and it is a frequent dish at many upper-class family reunions.", "Flesh Fondgoo: Captured by a human from beyond the stars with an unnatural hunger, the chef only had servitude as a survival option. Becoming comforter and preparer of meals, the new take on the fondgoo proved to be delectable with the right ingredients. Thin slices of half-orc proved to be the most popular with the star cannibal and his crew, wildly rich with only mild game flavor from the mixed heritage. The gourmet would never admit it to anyone, but his refined palate preferred the gnoll. The terror only ended after discovering what they thought was a holy grail, a Hungering Flesh that went from cornucopia to consumer in no short order.", "Roasted Phoenix: When youâre done, you toss the bones in the fire and *pop* the phoenix is back. Also, you can always cook it just right; if you keep going, then it loops rare through well done.", "Forever Stew: made with a bit of troll meat which is still regenerating. If managed carefully, one only needs to add vegetables and can continue making a meaty stew night after night, indefinitely.

It is served with Rice and Potatoes. This Dwarven dish has been since outlawed, with the discovery of the complexity of Flumph society. Although some still prepare it, as not only is it a delicious food, the psionic energy left on the meat brings joy to those who eat it.", "Neogi Neck: one of the few parts of the Neogi that are not poisonous, the Neogiâs neck has tender meat and takes months to spoil. As such, itâs often sought out by adventurers tired of eating the same old dried meat when on the road.", "Dry Stirge: this is a common folk food. In places with Stirge infestations, meat is often spoiled as these tiny creatures suck all of its blood and nutrients. Because of that, locals recur to it to replace their meat. The Stirge is prepared on a campfire, but because of the many types of blood that it sucks, it often leads to the eater contracting some sort of disease.", "Party meat: Nobody knows who had the terrifying idea of powdering sugar on Kruthik tissue, but certainly it was a madman.

Butcher the ribs down small enough to fit into your ceramic oven and cook overnight in your favourite pork sauce, before revelling in the delicious taste of possibly the most amazing ribs you will ever taste.", "Remorhaz Stew: Remorhaz is a wonderful meat for stews in that it retains heat forever! The Heat immune properties of the Remorhaz become fallible after their death, but they still require extremely high temperatures to be able to cook. Think smelting furnace, not oven. With such high temperatures required, Remorhaz needs to be cooked by eye due to the limited availability of such heat sources.

Sufficiently heated Remorhaz meat will stay hot for hours, even up to a day or two, keeping any stew it is added to hot as long as you wish.", "Roasted Bulette Flank: Bulette flesh is damnably tough and needs to be slow cooked with extreme patience. Combine red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, mustard, rosemary, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste to make a marinade. Cut the flank steaks off of the body and marinade them for at least a full day before roasting while continuously basting with the drippings. Once finished you will have a beautifully flavoursome and moist flank that while slightly gritty, is worth the effort of cooking it.",
            "Cave Fisher Sushi: As some of you may know, Cave Fisher blood ignites if exposed to flame or excess heat, therefore the best way to prepare it is to cut the meat into sushi sized pieces and drain as much blood as possible from the flesh before igniting and letting the excess blood burn off, lightly flaming the sushi for perfect preparation. Serve on Sushi rice with soy sauce.", "Forest Garbage Sauce: Anything you can use. Violet fungus, myconids, moss, mushrooms. Provides a hearty, earthy base.

Quippers taste uncompromisingly bitter and have an awful crunch to them. They still arenât very good once dipped in boiling tree sap, but at least they are covered in candyâ¦", "Honeyed Sirenâs Tongue: The tongue of a siren produces the most wonderful sound when chewed, bards will often accompany instrumental performances with the chewing of a Sirenâs tongue in order to woo crowds even further. Mixing it with honey makes it slightly easier to chew, but cooking it causes it to lose these magical effects.", "Water Elemental Juice: The fluid harvested from a living water elemental has been known to retain effervescent properties after being harvested due to residual magic power left over in the collected sample. Water elemental juice can be mixed with anything from potions to fruit juice to make a refreshing bubbly beverage. It is suggested to not drink the substance without dilution.", "Pixie Salad: A tossed salad of finely chopped pixies will always produce the flavors of the colors of the rainbow.

Chop them, Sear them, cook two behir eggs in the left over grease, and create an excellent set of breakfast burritos. For a bit of added fun, they are best served on the toe nail.", "Rib-hirs: Behirâs are nasty buggers, but theyâre good for one thing: ribs. The longest rib cage you will find, gather up your town, or the local goliath tribe, and youâll make a killing off of these. Flay the scales and smoke at a low heat over hickory logs for 2 days, slowly rotating the ribs through. A nice baste of dwarven ale mixed with citrus, or a rub of an orcish spice blend will make this a meal to remember. Just keep in mind the smell will travel for miles, so you might attract a nearby Roc.", "Roc Stock & Balor: While not actually made with Balor flesh, this demonic delicacy is as the name implies a stew made from Roc stock and any sort of demonic flesh. Due to the hellish nature of the flesh, the stew does not need any outside heat to work itself to a hearty temperature.

This monstrosity is laced with latent magic designed to lessen the chance of drinkers dying from its ungodly alcohol content, and reportedly tastes like 'A kick in the face from a horse.' After one shot of this drink, the drinker is shunted into a chaotic haze of blurry awareness, bolstered confidence, and overpowering drunkenness. In addition, the latent magic in the brew causes minor, uncontrolled magical effects to occur around the drinker at random times during the haze.

Often used as a torture method but sometimes drunk to prove ones mental strength, as those that canâ t endure it go insane. The niner is a rare drink because itâs extremely hard to make.

            "Stranger's Heart - Made from leaves of the Succubus Kiss, a parasitic red vine with lip shaped leaves that wraps around young trees, this bitter tea makes you feel in love for a few minutes but with no one in particular. Can be addictive for some people.", "Mountain Fire - Made from Scorched Berries that grown at the base of some volcanoes. The berries are poisonous but once boiled and then dried they can be turned into a spicy drink that fills you with warmth and releases tensions in the body. Drinking more then one cup might make you sweat profusely.", "Morning Sun - Made traditionally from a mix of orange peels and Croissant Lotus petals by monks of the Zenchu River, this bittersweet infusion helps with morning grogginess and giving a productive an early start. Also helps to resist sleep spells.", "Gundyr's Ice Breaker - A bestseller during flu season, this algae based infusion has a strong salty taste but will clear your airways in minutes. Despite it's usefulness, only few people would risk collecting the Ice Grappler Algea that grow under the ice of frozen lakes. Gundyr is on of them.", "Sharp Moonlight - A tea made from the petals of a flower (from a cactus) that blooms only under the moonlight. The leaves must be harvested and processed before the morning, when the petals will, if left to their own, have all wilted. In small amount, Sharp Moonlight helps people sleep, but larger doses can produce hallucinogenic dreams. Many report feeling as if they were one with the moon themselves.", "KhÃ¢rt (pronounced Curt with a hard c) - A dwarven tea made from the Khyr fungus, which only grows deep underground and physically resembles the black truffle. The tea possesses a bitter, spicy, and pungent aroma and is a potent stimulant, with its precise effects varying depending on method of preparation and the precise provenance of the khyr. The most commonly found type has the khyr being finely minced, dried, and pressed into bricks for easier storage and transport. This tea instills alertness and creativity with a slight sense of euphoria, making it a prized commodity amongst wizards, philosophers, and courtiers in many lands (albeit most prefer to add other things to mask the taste), and a major dwarven trade good.", "Forge-Fire - Whilst KhÃ¢rt is a common beverage with not very much cultural significance to the dwarves, forge-fire is a brew steeped in ceremony, and it is only consumed by dwarven masters of a craft before undertaking a great endeavor, whether it be a warrior leading a charge against an enemy army, a runeworker making a gate impervious to ram or explosive, or a smith forging the armor of a king. The khyr used in forge-fire is of the highest quality, and the most prized for forge-fire is khyr found growing upon the graves of a dwarf's ancestors or prior masters of the art, as the dwarves believe those specific fungi are gifts from the ancestors and hold some of their skill. Forge-fire is prepared by the drinker in a ritual that takes around 6 hours, during which the dwarf meditates on their ancestors, their training and knowledge, and the magnitude of the task ahead. The tea itself is prepared rather strangely: the khyr is finely sliced and placed into a wide and shallow bowl (often an ornate heirloom) and over it is poured strong mushroom brandy. The mixture is set alight and the heat from the burning, along with the tincturing from the alcohol, produce the infusion. A final incantation is sung and the brew is drunk whilst it is still burning. The brew fills the user with single-minded focus and vigor, making their movements swift, sure, and tireless, with many under its effects being known to work without stopping for days or even weeks. However, the aftereffects are extremely unpleasant, almost as if their life energy itself has burned up, and often leave the dwarf bedridden for months, and those who have consumed it claim to have felt that they utterly lost themselves in the chorus of ancestors and the purity of the craft, . In all dwarven history, few have consumed the forge's flame thrice, and none have survived it.", "Corpses Caffeine - Made from the petals of a corpse flower. When crushed they can be turned into an orange paste that can be infused in hot water to make a bitter but smooth tea. This tea makes you more aware of dead organisms near you.", "Natureâs wake - Made from an old ritual flower used by Druidâs to talk to nature. The petals of this flower are a bright and luminous white but, when dropped in boiling water, the liquid turns black with patches of green. Stir for 10 minutes and drink in one sip is the recommended brewing and drinking time. If brewed and drank correctly, nature will keep you safe for 24 hours. Examples of this would be nature guiding you out of a forest, trees protecting you like a shield.", "Leafwalker's Sensation - Crushed and dried leaves and sprigs from a Dryad's very own branches. The taste isn't different from other green teas, but it's magical warmth will flood inside your throat and belly. If the ingredients were gifted from a dryad, this tea will nourish and soothe to your inner core -mind, body and soul- and awakens your connection to the Fey for a short while. Just don't drink any that was harvested from a dead or unwilling Dryad...", "Dragonâs Balm - Sometimes chewed, this spiky leaf is known to any wood-witch or hermit worth their salt - a common sight among roadside plants and overgrown gardens. When brewed the leaf gives off a strong smoky aroma - drinking it makes your breath smell slightly of woodsmoke and brimstone. The short term effects are as a mild stimulant - a particularly potent brew might help someone work tirelessly for several hours or walk twice as far in a day. Those under its effects seem artificially chipper and may talk more than they mean to. The aftereffects are marked; a mild and not unpleasant lethargy usually followed by a deep and untroubled sleep. Valued by travelers and those living in peaceful locales for its use in travel and ease in ensuring a full nightâs rest, the wise avoid its use when danger looms or work must continue at great length - the sleep of Dragon's Balm is difficult to rouse from and the lethargy lasts until the body is allowed to completely rest. Repeated use runs the risk of dependence, and the tea will begin staining the teeth orange over time.", "Ghostflower Tea - Used by mediums and those who wish to commune with the dead - this tea must be prepared in a special ritual lasting an hour. The ritual involves selecting the proper leaves and bulbs from this unassuming but rare white-gold flower and painstakingly removing the tiny black pods that spread from the flowerâs open bell. Each pod must be shucked and its contents ground, but when the tea is finally imbibed the user can interact with and speak to the dead. The imbiber will be wreathed in a soft glow for the duration, and appear translucent under moonlight. Given a strong enough dose, they will be able to pass through flimsier solid objects - this effect is rare and taking too much Ghostflower tea is dangerous. The dead become attracted to those who drink this tea; an unlucky medium may drink to speak to a lost loved one or question a murder victim or ancient lord only to find themselves the focus of every unquiet dead or revenant for miles around. Drinking poorly prepared tea or drinking two doses in a single changing of the moon (a month) can give the imbiber intense visual hallucinations and make them violently ill; they have been known to speak at length to visions of their dead loved ones or ancestors and carry out battles against imaginary foes. The skin of a victim of Ghostflower poisoning will be pale and flushed; the blood will not clot and they bleed freely. Those with weak constitutions may perish. Individuals who die while under the effects of ghost flower tea are more likely to become spirits themselves.", "Moon Tea - Brewed by witches, midwives, queens and bachelors - this tea is from an uncommon leafy plant of green-grey leaves. Bitter smelling but sweet on the tongue, having two cups of this at most an hour before coitus will prevent pregnancy. Some claim it heightens sensation and others that it ages the body, but when taken by any sex its efficacy is renowned. Babies born from unions where one or both parent take this tea are considered lucky by many, and the child of such a union is often marked by green flecks in their eyes. This plant is harvested so regularly that what was once a common sight in every garden and back patio has become a valuable commodity; this is because improper harvesting yields sufficient quantities for a dose while killing this fragile plant.", "Willwillown - a common long leaf tea that grows on hillsides and is hardy. Usually drunk as a before midday tea but has several flavored varieties by mixing it with florals like Rill or Munlack or Pepper Flower, or with citrus peels. Gnomes like it baked rather than air dried as it rounds out the body, but they also brew it strong and tanneny which others find unpleasant. Dwarves will sometimes chew Willwillown berries but humans find them bitter and unpalatable.", "Moradin's Loose Leaf - Made from the leaves of Ironwood and a proprietary blend of black tea leaves steeped in a forge's quenching bucket. Gives the drinker renewed vigor to continue hammering, bending and cutting long past many of the younger dwarves.", "Avlat - Made from leaves of a vine that grows wild in poor soil. Brews a peppery, copper-colored tea that is a bit of an acquired taste, but often is used to accentuate other bold flavors, such as those found in rich wines, sauces, and ales.", "Beorunna's Cure-All Named, oddly enough, for a legendary barbarian queen credited with its discovery, this bitter-tasting tea made from boiled stems located in the Savage Frontier has taken on an austere reputation among healers and herbalists. The first time a creature that consumes this tea regains hit points from any source in the following hour, they regain 2d4 additional hit points.", "Blackthorn - Brewed from the leaves of the blackthorn shrub, producing a savory tea with earthy woody notes, and a fruity, tangy aftertaste. This tea is known to calm an upset stomach, and is remarkably common in the Dragon Coast and Dragon Reach.", "Blueleaf - Harvested from the leaves of the bitterhedge plant, plentiful throughout the Realms and used to ward off common crop parasites. When brewed, creates an off-blue tea that is slightly sweet with an almost minty aftertaste. Many enjoy this tea recreationally, though used medicinally it suppresses nausea and dysentery for 8 hours after consumption.", "Chalthorn - Made from grey, furry weeds that plague farmers in Sembia and the Dalelands, this cloudy tea has a dry, chalky taste that is difficult to like. However, when a creature drinks this tea, it becomes unable to taste spice in food for one hour, rendering the most spicy of cuisine palatable.", "Coffee - A potent drink with a bold, robust yet bitter flavor, energizing to those that drink it. A creature cannot sleep or be put to sleep by any means for an hour after drinking coffee.", "Coffee, Dwarvish - A thick, sluggish liquid, almost syrupy in texture and black as midnight.

Drinking this tea calms the mind and numbs the throat and tongue, suppressing any madness effects the character suffers for one hour.", "Gaeth'ad - A tea brewed by the orcs of the Shadow Marches, tasting thick and brackish, with a flavor that stays on the tongue. A versatile if incredibly pungent drink, it can be  brewed as a mild stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic, depending on methods used when brewing.", "Jethur - Purplish and (usually) as savory as broth, this tea is made from dense clusters of fungi known as carpet mushrooms. The taste of this tea is known to shift as one drinks it, and it is renowned by merchants for its ability to induce sobriety and soothe digestion. A creature that drinks this tea suppresses the effects of any alcohol in their system for 2 hours.", "Long Jing - A rich and fragrant green tea, grown in Kara-Turâs Zhejiang province. Tradition holds that this tea can help cleanse the body of toxins, granting a creature that drinks it resistance to poison damage for one hour after consumption.", "Mallow - This light blue floral tea is popular in Maztica, often finding use as a sleep aid. It carries a light semi-sweet taste. If a creature drinks this tea before sleeping, they sleep free of nightmares and cannot be affected by the dream spell or similar abilities.", "Meiriath - A rich copper-colored beverage tasting of mango and citrus, popular with wealthy residents of Halruaa, Unther, and Mulhorand. Made from carefully-dried leaves of cave-sedge, a grass-like plant that grows in caves and other dark places.", "Mother's Leaf - A mellowing concoction, carrying with it strong grass and sage notes, a staple of healers in the Savage Frontier. If a creature that drinks this tea suffers from any diseases, they can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 13. On a success, one disease the creature suffers ends gradually after 24 hours. A creature can only attempt this saving throw once, requiring a long rest before attempting it again.", "Mourningberry - Traditionally found near graves and other deathly places, the leaves and flowers of this plant can be seeped into a tea, but its berries are mildly toxic. When brewed, the tea acts as a slight depressant, relaxing those that drink it and making them disinterested in conflict or confrontation. Often served ceremonially at funerals.", "Nararoot - A shaved-down tuber seeped into a tea, its natural licorice flavor is softened into a musky semi-sweet aroma. This tea functions as a form of birth control; a female humanoid that drinks this tea is rendered infertile for a period of 2 weeks. A similar tea for male humanoids is derived from cassil, though that tea costs 10 gp for every 1/20 lb.", "Pale Jade - A light and airy white tea, cultivated in Kara-Tur, primarily within Shou Lung. A popular export, many merchants and tea connoisseurs hold this tea as an excellent introduction to proper tea drinking.", "Par-Salian's Blend - A smoky, citrus-rich blend of herbs that soothes the throat, passed down between the magi of Krynn.
