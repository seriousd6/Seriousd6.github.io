        A floating chest that when anything is removed from it creates a inescapable barrier around it that only goes away if the item taken, or something of equal or higher value is placed back in the chest. 
        A mirror that shows a parallel dimension version of whomever looks into it, with slight to large differences being shown. 
        A skull that can speak and remembers it's former life, but can do nothing else. 
        An enchanted broom that cleans on its own, but also has a personality of a disgruntled dog. 
        A working spirit board, that allows limited communication with whatever spirits may be near. 
        A magical vending machine that when a gold is deposited, it creates and gives a 3' wood statue of who ever is standing in front of it. 
        Giant ceramic jars with holes in them for air, and a trickle of water. The jars are the size of houses and magically sedate (and then force into hibernation and then stasis) anyone who enters them in short order. They are a form of larder for keeping sentient creatures alive and fat until thier time to be eaten. 
        A crown that puts the wearer to sleep, but then transforms the world around them into a twisted version of what they are dreaming. The dream ends if the crown is removed. The more powerful lucid dreamers can even interact and live in this dream world, which grows larger the more powerful they are. 
        A porthole of desire. There's some standing stone, with a hole carved out through to the otherside. It shows the observer the greatest desire of a person they are observing through the porthole, examples include a spider subject where everything is covered in webs, and dog and their owner playing together, or an ork burning down the world. 
        A prayer wheel assembly with a near infinite number of runes in an ancient and pre-verbal form of celestial. With it, one might spend a 5th level spell slot and gain a use of a spell similar to Commune with a deity that is within 1 step of the caster's alignment. They may ask up to 8 questions, but the DM must SECRETLY flip a coin each question up to a maximum of 2d4-1 times (max once each question). On tails, the answer she gives must be False or a Lie. If Heads, instead the answer must be True, if cryptic. After the 2d4-1 confusions have occured, then the resulting answers must be True. Using the device more than once per day requires a DC15 Wisdom save, or the user takes a point of exhaustion. 
        An eternally screaming fire skull. It’s not in pain or anything, just bored. Giving it something that might distract it might stop the screaming. 
        A black stone statue of a frog filling a cubic foot, weighing 150 lbs. Expend a spell slot of at least level one. Every flying insect, bug, creepy crawly, and flying vermin of size Tiny or smaller within a 40 foot cube centered on the frog is snatched by shadowy lashing tongues of force. After 1 hour, roll a d6. On a 5 or higher, the item creates 1d3 goodberries. The statue continue snatching insects for 1d4 hours after activation, a higher level spell slot multiplies the duration. Roll again for goodberries after each hour. The frog is capable of attacking swarms as well, dealing 1d6 hp worth of damage to the swarm or single Tiny flying creature within its range of effect every round, for the duration. 
        Orb of Distant Sight: A crystal sphere the size of a basketball, weighing 50 pounds. Spend a 1st level spell slot, and an image of anything located within a 40 foot cube (within line of sight of the orb, and within a maximum range of thirty miles, or the horizon, whichever is closer) is shown, projected within a 10 foot cube adjacent to the orb, as per the spell Silent Image. The image updates in real time. Using a full round action, the area spied upon may be moved up to 40 feet per round, within range, and the Orb's effect lasts for 1d10 minutes. Spending a higher level spell slot multiplies the duration of effect. Additionally, once per day, spend a Level 1 spell slot, and the Orb may be used to project an image in the reverse manner to a point within the same range, as per the spell Silent Image for 1d10 rounds. Higher level spell slots multiply the duratiom of this effect. Using the orb in this manner prevents its use for any other purpose for a full 8 hours. 
        Altar of Imbuement: A smoked boxwood altar three feet to a side, with fine ivory handles wrapped in gold wire and decorated with cabochons of Onyx and Amber. A fine golden chalice is mounted inside the altar. Place a magical item that has at least 1 charge remaining, expend a divine spell slot of at least level 1, and pray for 8 hours; roll a d6, on a 5 or higher the item will regain 1 charge (up to a maximum of 3 charges in a 1 month period, or 6 charges per year, whichever happens sooner). Spending a higher level spell slot reduces the required d6 roll, becoming automatic when a 6th level divine spell is expended. 
        The Burning Bell: A courtroom with a sinister looking, large-sized black-iron bell (with no clapper) with adamantine bands is mounted six feet above the floor in a central position. The bell weighs over 200,000 pounds and is twenty feet tall and ten feet across at the base. When rung, it peals at B♭-1 (14.5 Hz) and can be heard for up to 10 miles. While painfully loud, a strange property of the amphitheater is that it protects those inside it from the bulk of hearing damage from the bell's peal. A marble dais is built directly beneath the bell, while a second (more ornately carved) is nearby. The sound of the bell is almost completely muted while standing on either dias. The courtroom is shaped like an amphitheater, with rising levels of seating behind the second dias. The bell (and surrounding temple courtroom) is covered with bas-releif pictoglyphs in a forgotten tongue, the glyphs demonstrate a man standing burning beneath the bell, while those surrounding fall to thier knees. Spend a spell slot of at least third level, and the bell peals, sustaining itself for 3d6 minutes, a higher level spellslot multiplies the length of this effect. While active, anyone hearing the bell (including those on the dais) is under the effects of the spell Zone of Truth. Attempting to lie causes physical pain (and potentially damage) that increases to a maximum beneath the bell. Within the first d6 minutes, the Will DC beneath the bell is equal to the 16+caster's proficiency bonus. This decreases by 1 for every d6 minutes or 100 feet of distance (to a minimum of DC10). Those who lie while beneath the bell suffer 3d6 Sonic damage and 3d6 fire damage (reduced by 1d6 for every 10 feet of distance or d6 minutes, to a minimum of 2 sonic and 2 fire). They may attempt a CON save equal to the same DC (as to lie) to only suffer half damage. 
        Goblets of Shattering: A set of at least seven fragile musical crystal goblets. Up to once per hour, when all are played at once, it casts the spell Shatter against targets within range. Roll a d6. On a 1, this causes one of the goblets to break as well, but the damage dealt is doubled. If all the goblets are broken, the magical set no longer functions. 
        The Whispering Pillars: A set of 60 foot tall pillars, intricately carved. Anyone seated at the top of a pillar suffer the following effects (during) and up to 1d6 hours after leaving: Blinded (CON DC15 resist), Silence (WILL DC15 resist), and Slow (DEX DC15 resist). While seated at the top of the pillar, the creature gains ADV on sound based Perception checks and a +5 bonus, being able to hear even a whisper up to ten miles away, as if they were right next to the whisperer. Additionally, once per eight hours, the listener may use the effect of the spell Detect Thoughts against one creature they perceive within 1d6 miles. 
        A heavy gold plated metal washtub weighing 300 pounds. Six feet long, three feet across and three feet deep. When mostly filled with clean warm water, any object or creature placed within the tub is cleansed as per the spell Prestidigitation. It also smells strongly of either rosewater, jasmine, orange blossom, mint, smoked sausage/bacon/steak, sandalwood, patchouli, or lavender (roll a d8), for up to one hour. 
        A Giant Pendulum in a Garguantuan Grandfather Clock: Movement speed in the room is doubled, but all creatures in the room are under the effects of Slow (Will DC 15, resist at start of each round) or Haste (Will DC 15, resist at start of round), determined by a coinflip for each creature upon entering the area, or at the start of thier turn. 
        A fancy room with a very accurate dollhouse inside that creates dolls of anyone or anything within 100 feet. Interacting with the dolls or furniture moves and affects their counterparts as well, and againstvliving creatures the effect is like that of a Voodoo doll (Will/Str/Con DC 15 to resist at the start of the round. Resist three rounds and you are immune to the effect until your next long rest.) Each round, the contents of the house reflect reality. Damaging or destroying the dollhouse deals an equal amount of damage to all within range.

    mystic grimoires
        This grimoire
        is bound with a cover made from human teeth and nails.
        was inked with the discoloured blood of inhuman beasts.
        is a mere fragment of a greater work, all that could be preserved from a purge.
        is, or has become, a living creature. Its pages pulse with a faint heartbeat, and absorb unwary worms for sustenance.
        has synaesthetic text, words that are smelled or felt more than read.
        changes its exact wording each time it’s read.
        always appears in the dreams of those who’ve read it before, where it remains perfectly legible.
        will pluck at the strings of fate to place itself in the possession of ambitious sorts if it’s sealed away for too long.
        is a glass puzzlebox which projects its text when a light is shone through it. Rearranging it reveals another segment of text.
        has increasingly deranged marginalia scribbled in a dozen different hands in its open spaces.
        makes you speak its words aloud as you read it, someone else’s voice coming from your throat.
        appears to be written in gibberish until you add your signature to the many that fill its otherwise blank front page.
        glows with a sickly light, so that it is legible even in total darkness.
        seems fated to injure its readers. One can scarcely turn a page without getting a papercut.
        has a section of actual human spine as its spine.
        is fireproof, and can only be read in full by immolating it.
        causes its reader’s eyes to bleed. Reading it too much inflicts blindness, as readers become unable to see anything but the grimoire.
        is a stack of clay tablets. There’s more tablets in the stack than it seems there should be based on its size and weight, and any tablets removed or destroyed inexplicably return to the stack.
        heals any damage done to it, leaving a mottled scar.
        is written in a code that takes sustained effort to crack. Without this effort, it seems to be a mundane cookbook.
        DThis grimoire was written
        by a doomed poet who dove deep into a mystery cult for inspiration.
        by a scholar who claimed to have tapped into the Akashic Records, where all knowledge is stored.
        by a popular medium while in a trance, shortly before their mysterious disappearance.
        by a priest who became obsessed with dubious apocrypha.
        by an unknown authour. It simply appeared in history one day.
        by an entire village, one page to a person, before they walked together into the night, never to be seen again.
        by a thousand deranged monkeys.
        by the head doctor of an asylum, based on the rantings of their patients.
        by the hands of an infamous thief, after they were cut off as punishment.
        by a historian based on their collated research on several lost civilizations.
        by a child who claimed to have been inspired by their imaginary friend.
        some time in the future. What you might find of it now is an imperfect, backwards copy anticipating its own original.
        shamefully, by a secret heresiarch.
        apparently long before any other example of written language.
        by a self-proclaimed prophet who claimed to have received its text in a god-granted vision.
        by a hermit best known for throwing their feces at visitors.
        by a jaded noble who brought ruin to their estate in pursuit of limit-experiences.
        by a professor and their closest students, who barricaded their university and slaughtered the rest of the inhabitants.
        as a bowdlerization of a yet more dreadful tome.
        by the hands of the true creator of the world, allegedly.
        DThe lore which this grimoire contains
        is rituals to summon demons, though not to control or banish them.
        is how to mix potions which induce mutation.
        is the secret names of angels, which allow them to be bound against their will.
        is the location of a dormant undead army and the means to command it.
        is how to open portals to inchoate realms beyond the conventional cosmos.
        is knowledge of how to enslave human souls to animate fell golems.
        is rituals to transform oneself into a kind of intelligent undead: a vampire, a ghoul, a lich, and stranger sorts besides.
        is a tragically flawed ritual to resurrect the dead.
        is spells to cook together living things into hybrid monsters.
        is rites to commune with a banished and vengeful divinity.
        is a rite to shuck one’s own dooms, curses, and misfortunes onto a more innocent scapegoat.
        describes how to slip one’s soul away from just punishment in the hereafter, or damn another to far worse than they deserve.
        is rituals to transfer your mind into another’s body, consuming their self in the process, or to splinter off pieces of your mind to fester and infect another’s.
        is how to call up plagues, but not how to cure them.
        is the method to create a sphere of annihilation.
        can be used to immanentize the eschaton.
        is knowledge of how to remove human organs and replace them with empowering alien substitutes.
        is how to steal life-force from others to enhance and extend one’s own.
        is charms to bend the minds of others.
        is how to steal and pervert divine magic.
        DThis grimoire was forbidden
        so that its temptation to prospective seekers would be increased.
        not for the lore it contained, but rather for its satirical preface which offended a political leader.
        because hidden in its text is a memetic weapon that drives readers mad.
        because its cover forms a seal that unleashes a malign spirit while it is open.
        because it’s a failed attempt at a phylactery, and so its writer(s)’s ghost(s) can haunt anyone who’s read it.
        because it was used to facilitate an atrocity.
        due to the blasphemous ideas its text promulgates.
        because none of its lore is accurate, and is in fact a trick for an even darker purpose.
        because reading it is a spiritual hazard that dooms one’s soul to a truly unfortunate afterlife.
        because it’s proof of the limits of safe, sane magic.
        because of the machinations of a sorcerer who thought it plagiarized their own work.
        because it was once the key element in a plot to hasten the apocalypse.
        because the lore it contains could destabilize the natural order of things.
        because prophecy held that great evil would follow if it were not kept out of sight of perusing eyes.
        because the gods have a habit of smiting indiscriminately around it.
        by a tyrant who didn’t want anyone else to be able to tap its power.
        due to popular demand.
        because as it’s read it refines and expands on itself by reading in turn the minds of its readers.
        because the publishing house that owns the rights to it gets violently litigious if there’s any chance it might be copied.
        as an excuse to seize it for an authority’s use.
        DThis grimoire might be found
        locked up in the archives of a scholastic monastery.
        in the hoard of a dragon who gathers knowledge rather than gold.
        in a parasitic, paradimensional library that siphons the collection and readers of other libraries.
        in the study of a libertine aristocrat.
        as the centrepiece of a mystery cult.
        in a sealed chest in a mermaid’s sea-cave, looted from a shipwreck.
        chained to the wrist of a cenobite-censor.
        within the wooden shell of a filing-golem.
        in the possession of a cult transcribing it onto woodblocks for printing and widespread distribution.
        through a map encoded in an occultist’s notes.
        clutched in a dead wizard’s desiccated claws.
        in the lab of a researcher trying to extract insights palatable to conventional magical practice.
        in a revolutionary’s hideout, as a weapon of last resort.
        as the heirloom of a clan of backwoods hedge-witches.
        in a tower on a barren island, its garrison all dead of simultaneous suicide.
        sorted among mundane codexes by a senile bureaucrat.
        locked in a safe in an inquisitor’s office.
        in the possession of an orphan being groomed by a loose familiar to become an obedient archmage.
        in a decrepit sanctum, guarded by a vampire awaiting the return of their master’s reincarnation to claim it.
        in the ash-piles of a failed book burning.

        Peg-leg. This NPC has one wooden leg, just like the classic pirate captains used to have.
        Missing eyebrows. This NPC has no eyebrows. It’s really difficult to see what kind of expression he or she is making, therefore players have disadvantage on wisdom (Insight) checks concerning this NPC.
        Musical Madness. This NPC likes to sing his/her way through life. Everybody kind of hates it, but the high notes hang around like flies when this NPC is singing (which he/she does instead of talking).
        Scared of Little People. This NPC somehow is extremely scared of halflings, gnomes and dwarves. He/She could very well be one of those races him/herself, but they’ll only hang around with larger people. Why this NPC feels this way, I’m not sure. Maybe you know?

        Slow Speaker. This NPC speaks at least twice as slowly as normal people do. All the while seemingly oblivious to the annoyance it raises in others.
        Natural Born Trader. This NPC tries to sell you everything it can. 'See this chair? It’s yours for just two gold pieces! See this flower? Yours for a piece of silver, it’s really rare! See my wife/husband? It’s yours for…'
        Not a care in the world. This NPC is unbelievably happy. They only see the good in life and are extremely positive.
        Higher than thou. This NPC feels like the fucking king/queen of the country. They talk down to almost everyone and use a (what they think is) a royal way of speaking.
        Just Married. This NPC just got married and can’t stop talking about their wife/husband.
        Peeyou. This NPC dislikes words that start with the letter P. Each time this NPC hears a word that does indeed start with a P, he/she cringes in disgust.
        What’s this for? This NPC doesn’t use his left arm. He/She just leaves it hanging, doing nothing. There’s nothing wrong with the arm, the NPC just doesn’t use it at all. For nothing.
        Classic Tammy. This NPC has underwear visible above his or her pants. It’s not that his/her pants are really low, but his/her underwear is just really high. Roll a d4 to determine the state of the underwear, Clean, nothing special, Dirty and torn, Obviously way too tight, Very sexy.

        Weirdest Mutton Chops Ever. This NPC, whether it’s a he or a she doesn’t matter, has the weirdest mutton chops anyone has ever seen. They are a different color than the rest of his/her hair and they are somehow intricately braided.
        Final Countdown. This NPC counts down after each conversation. The NPC has a conversation with the party, and when they or the NPC leave, the NPC utters: 73. When the party then asks: 'What was that?' The NPC will claim to not know what they are talking about, then leaves again saying: 72. Good luck roleplaying this one.
        Grumpy face. This NPC has a face that says: 'I hate everything. I hate hating everything.' Basically, his or her face looks incredibly pissed off all the time, even though he or she might be very happy.
        Poker face. This NPC has a poker face. It’s nearly impossible to discern any emotions, all insight checks on this NPC need to be made with disadvantage.
        To be or not to be. This NPC is desperately trying to become an actor/actress. He/She is not very good at it though. In normal conversations this NPC sounds like he or she is talking on stage, it sounds very fake and extremely articulated.
        Lip Licker. This NPC licks his lips, a lot. I mean really, this NPC licks his or her lips constantly. It’s extremely unsettling.
        Shaving Sucks. This NPC is very bad at shaving. If it’s a man, he has a lot of small cuts on his face. With a successful DC8 perception or insight check it’s pretty clear that they are the result of terrible shaving. If the NPC is a woman, it is almost the same, but instead the cuts are located on her legs (Yes, even in D&D some women shave their legs. Trust me!).
        Wild Accuser. This NPC accuses everyone he talks to of minor crimes, like littering, or making too much noise.
        Am I hearing this right? This NPC mishears almost everything. He/She thinks he/she heard everything right, and continues the conversation on whatever subject he/she thinks he/she heard. For example: 'Can you tell us where the Inn is?' The NPC hears: 'Can you tell us where Theon is?' And responds with: 'I have no idea who that is, I’m sorry!' If you still want the NPC to be helpful, make him/her understand every sentence correctly when he/she hears them a second time.
        Puppet Pal. This NPC always has a wooden puppet with him/her. Whatever his relationship with this puppet is, is up to you as a DM. Good luck!
        Bless you! This NPC has a permanent cold. Always a runny nose and sneezing all the time.
        Broken down. This NPC has a broken limb. Roll a d4 to decide which: Their good arm, Their other arm, One leg, Both legs and their good arm.
        Permanent Ink. This NPC has a large tattoo of an animal’s head on their neck. If you can’t think of an animal yourself then it’s a chicken’s head.
        Loading, please wait. This NPC needs some time processing conversations. Whenever you talk to him/her, it takes them 1d6 + 5 full seconds to respond. Even if it’s a short and simple question.
        Whispering guide. This NPC has a small creature hidden in their hair that whispers advice and insight into their ear. The creature is a Sprite, which has the ability to turn invisible and sense if anyone is lying by touching them.
        My brother, there art thou! This NPC is convinced that one of the party members is their long lost brother or sister. He or she will not be easily convinced of the contrary.
        Shapeshifter. This NPC is actually a doppler. The players might notice subtle changes in the NPC’s physical attributes each subsequent visit, like a smaller nose, another eye colour or an extra feet in height.
        Lilac and Gooseberries. This NPC smells like lilac and gooseberries, a particular smell that might be familiar to some of the players.
        Mouthful. This NPC always has something in his/her mouth. It could be food… but they never swallow. And it's too big to be chewing gum. It makes this NPC very hard to understand.
        The Narrator. This NPC always speaks about him or herself in the third person, and he or she narrates everything that happens in their vicinity.
        Narcissist. This NPC is always holding a mirror, looking at him or herself while blowing kisses and winking. It looks away now and then to look at the party but he or she mostly looks at themselves.
        Needlessly Shifty. This NPC comes across as very shifty. He or she laughs sneakily after answering questions or making deals, like he or she is hiding something. But they aren't, it's just a weird mannerism they were born with.
        Fungal infection. This NPC has a small growth of blue green fungus on one of their cheeks. Under close scrutiny the fungus almost seems to pulsate with every heartbeat.
        Squinter. This NPC squints their eyes at the party. It looks like he/she needs a pair of glasses.
        Mad hatter. This NPC wears a really long, really silly pointy hat. It's over 3 feet (1 meter) tall, made up of different kinds of materials and colors. Possible explanation for why the NPC is wearing it: 1. Their kid made it for them and now they are pretty much obligated to wear it. 2. They made it themselves because they believe it will make them a really powerful wizard. 3. It is a cursed hat that can't be removed and someone put it on their head while they were sleeping.
        Sketch artist. This NPC is scribbling on a piece of paper while he or she is talking to the party. After a while they proudly show the sketch they made of one of the party members. Roll 1d6/2 to see how good this NPC is. Very, very bad. Extremely average. Very, very good.
        Want a cookie? This NPC bakes their own cookies and offers to anyone and everyone to try. Roll 1d6/2 to determine the quality. Terrible, bitter and is that a hair? Average, OK cookies. These are amazing, crunchy, sweet and something you can't quite put your finger on but it's awesome.
        Juggler. This NPC is an excellent juggler and will juggle everytime he or she has two or more items in his or her hands. Their limit is 1d6 + 3 items at once.
    doggos
        Volmusian Ember Hair - A breed derived from fire elemental stock, bred by druids as attack animals. Fiery red hair, maned, with a sturdy frame and short snout. 1d3 Fire damage/round if within 5ft and the dog dislikes you.
        Mutt of Tindalos - Possessed of the blood of creatures which exist outside of space-time; this canine does not move, it simply stutters & teleports up to 40ft in a round instead. They are off-putting creatures, emaciated and long-limbed with greenish-grey fur.
        Hemohound - Descended from the hounds owned by vampires. Sable-furred, with crimson eyes and bodies built for pursuit. Hemohounds feed on blood, and biting living creatures heals them. Each successful bite restores 1 HP to the dog.
        Cerberusid - Smuggled out from Hades itself, these stocky, well-muscled and snub nosed dogs have multiple heads for observing the comings and goings of the dead. Advantage on anything to do with multi-tasking or perception. Roll 1d6 - 1-3: 2 heads, 4-6: 3 heads.
        Dorician Pale Dog - Developed by fakirs for the purposes of curing diseases, these wane and mangy beasts are capable of taking diseases into themselves by licking the afflicted and transferring them to another through the means of coughing or sneezing fits.
        Dolchean Mole-hound - A strange breed of canine developed by dwarves to help them guard their subterranean farms. Mole-hounds have short white fur, huge reflective eyes, and massive paws. These dogs can burrow and dig at half the speed at which they can run.
        Sivardian Chaser - These huge, grey-furred, and wolf like dogs were bred by Hobgoblins to keep pace with and flush out their traditional Centaur rivals. Chasers move 20ft faster a round than a typical canine.
        Phantom Cur - Cultivated from canines repeatedly revived through necromantic means, these eerie hounds outwardly seem like normal members of their species, but they often go minutes without breathing or days without blinking. Their own proximity to death allows them to sense and affect incorporeal beings.

        Troll-blooded Laika - This particular land race was developed by goblinoid tribes to aid them in their hunts and raids.

Laika eat double the amount of a typical dog.
        Poison Dart Dog - Inspired by the similarly named amphibian, a group of shaman deep within the jungles of Auyyuah have bred a line of canines capable of producing and expelling poisons.

        Platinum Retreiver - An offshoot of common hunting dogs, these somewhat dopey and friendly beasts can detect the presence of precious metals up to 60' away.

                Rumor: There’s a rumor going around about your party. A bad one. Nobody trusts you
                It is migrating season for Unicorns and this town is in the middle of their migration path. Despite their beauty, these Unicorns are dangerous and untrusting
                The entire town is riddled with traps and wires, be careful where you step
                As your party travels through the town, one member of the party seems to be teleported to another realm. In reality they haven’t moved at all. Stranger things have happened I’m sure. It’s probably nothing (It’s definitely something)
                Rumor: A man known as the Master of Riddles lives in town. He will reward anyone for solving his riddles. But the rewards are unlike anything anyone’s ever seen
                Taxidermied animals rampage through the streets, a Necromancer is to blame
                Your reoccurring 'Big Bad Villain' just happens to be in town. They don’t immediately recognize the party and seem to be doing some pretty domestic stuff. Is this their hometown or is this just a pit stop in their travels?
                This river settlement is quite large. They have just begun developing this area, most buildings are still being constructed. The tavern, inn and a few shops are open. Trouble looms in the distance as a large beast’s home is directly below
                Local pants thieves begin messing with the party and it is hilarious
                Rumor: Inside the oldest building in town there is an ancient door that is said to lead to the heavens. Nobody has ever been able to open the door, not even with magic. The key’s location is an unsolved mystery. Some say the key is buried somewhere nearby
                Rumor: Local inventor claims to have created a machine that can fly and is willing to pay anyone to give it a test run
                Dozens of missing person and lost item posters are all around the town (For an extra twist, one of the missing people is someone in the party)
                In the center of town lies a guild of mice adventurers. They protect this town and make sure all outsiders are trustworthy
                Take all the snacks and drinks you and your players brought to today’s session and create a boss fight out of it! It emerges from the earth with little to no warning
                A group of teens run around the city role playing their favorite book characters. Unfortunately these characters are swashbuckling looters. Time to put these kids in time out
                A traveling merchant sells odd wooden closets, drawers, and chests. When opened, these objects lead to portals between dimensions. Suddenly, one of the closets tip over and the doors swing open
                You open the door and find yourself into a nearly empty room. No furniture, lamps, tables. There is one person inside, a female human. Blindfolded. She’s kneeling on the floor. In front of her is a small candle. 'To a question, an answer, then a toll. But beware, those who beckon secrets often find the roil of time hides only regrets.' She sais, then she remains silent.
                You see the ghost of an old woman, sweeping the ground. She wears old-style clothes, her face a translucent web of wrinkles. She smiles and says 'Oh, new folks. And such quaint garbs. Does thy yearn for any thing? I can’t help much, dead as I am, but I too much love this little corner of town to leave it behind, always glad to lend a hand if possible.'
                There is a rackety stand on the side of the road with an old, scarred man sitting behind it. The items on display are very… peculiar. Weapons, tools and trinkets with strange shapes and colours. Some are moving on their own, others seem very ancient. Many people pass by and check it out, but very few seem to be buying something. The old man sighs. He explains he used to be an adventurer, but now he’s getting married, so he wants to settle down and sell his old stuff for more useful cash. He already sold most of it, what’s left is the bizarre and weird stuff.
                You see a young woman walking about. Sixteen at most. She’s wearing simple white robes with the church symbol on them and a brown leather bag filled with herbs and bottles slung over her shoulder.
                You hear people arguing loudly, a small crowd is gathering on the side of the road around them. You see two guards screaming at a small, balding dwarf in a dirty white shirt. The dwarf seems very apologetic. After a while, the guards simply push him to the ground and walk away. The dwarf is a private investigator. He messed up a big case and created problems for the guards. He’s not bad at his job, he says. If given an opportunity, and fair pay, he’s eager to prove he’s a capable hound.
                The road opens up as if it was a colossal mouth, dozens of meters long. Inside, instead of dirt and rocks, its inside is fleshy and squirmy. A few passersby and a cart with horses fall inside, their screaming doesn’t last long. The road closes, trembles, you hear a brutal crunching and crushing and squishing, then it opens up again.
                As you walk through the city at night, you see a wobbling light coming towards you. It’s a lantern bearer, accompanying someone. From a distance, they appear to be regular folks, but as you get close, an unnerving sensation starts crawling up your skin. The one carrying the lantern is hunched forward and dressed in patched-up rags that drag on the ground. The other one seems like a nobleman, his black jacket has golden buttons and trimmings, he’s wearing a top hat and has a walking stick. When they are closer, the two stop, and you hear the well-dressed man tell the other 'Wait here, I’ll have a quick snack before we go.' Then he starts walking towards you.
                A runaway carriage is rushing towards you, there is no driver, the horses seem in a frenzy, neighing and frothing. As it gets closer, you notice a small, impish creature is attached to one of the horses, sinking its claws in its flesh.
                A young gnome lady is pushing a small cart filled with candles, crying 'buy a light, buy a light for the night, good sirs.' As she gets close, she looks at you, and you see wax dripping from her eyes. 'A candle to light the way,' she says, as she overthrows the cart. Melted wax floods out, streaming around you, boiling, burning your skin, but you feel something else, twisted, deep, burning away at your mind. 'A light to find your way in the dim abyss of truth, good sir. A candle for the demented halls of the mortal mind.'
                A group of laughing kids rushes through your group, some bumping into you. They don’t steal anything, instead, they put something in your pocket: a shiny, red gem, as large as a chicken egg. A few seconds later, a large minotaur wielding an oversized butcher knife turns the corner, bloodshot eyes, foaming. 'I can feel you have it, you swines!' He screams 'I will butcher you like the thieving pigs you are and dig my gem out of your carcasses.'
                A procession of rats carrying around the town insignia walks through the street. Created by an experiment from the local magical academy, these intelligent rats escaped years ago and have formed an enclave within the city.
                Today is a local festivity. Wagons with masked people playing instruments go through the city, while the people in the crowd throw fruit at each other. At the end of the day, sometimes, spirits of the dead appear for a few hours to visit their families and dine with them.
                The players pass in front of a ruined building in the middle of town. Broken walls, grass everywhere, cobwebs and graffiti feel really out of place, surrounded by regular, well-kept houses. It’s a desecrated church. Its cult abandoned it a long time ago after some horrible thing happened in it, and the church isn’t allowed to demolish, fix or repurpose it, since it technically belongs to the church, so it lies abandoned despite being prime real estate, left to the weather, the homeless and animals.
                The players hear screaming in the distance. They turn a corner, and the street is occupied by two large groups of people, some dressed in green and red, others in blue and yellow. They are beating each other, it’s a huge brawl that occupies most of the street. Around them, more people are cheering, waving flags and throwing flowers. Two families have been rivals for a long time, but over the centuries it has become more tradition than real hate. Now, they have an annual brawl where they pummel each other before going to eat together.
                A store owners helped a druid, and in exchange, he was blessed, now animals love him. As a result, the entire street around his house is filled with wild animals just hanging around: barking dogs, scuttling rats, meowing cats, insects, birds. Poop and fur everywhere.
                The players notice something peering at them from a rooftop. An enormous humanoid covered in rags and chain, its face a grey, expressionless mask with burning red eyes. It looks at them for a few, extremely uncomfortable seconds, then pulls back and disappears.
                A group of kids rushes in front of the players, laughing and kicking a ball of raw leather, they turn a corner and disappear. A few moments later, the same kids pass again. Then a third time, always in the same direction. They aren’t going back and forth, they are repeating. The fourth time, someone that looks identical to the player to the smallest detail is running and playing with the kids.
                In the middle of the night, one of the players wakes up. Something warm is dripping on them. There is an eviscerated pig carcass hanging right over their bed, dripping blood. Other severed animal parts covered in fresh blood surround their bed. Everything is warm and slippery.
                A player wakes up in the middle of the night, something is crawling on their back. Something tiny, but fast. As they try and fail to grab it, from below the sheets, something grabs their foot.
                The players are casually walking through town, when they notice people are staring at them, pointing and laughing. They realize all of their clothes and equipment have, somehow, been switched around. Nobody is wearing their own clothes, and they look ridicolous. Nobody has their own weapon at hand. None of them noticed it happening.

        keep/stronghold encounters
            An old woman goes around, knocking at people’s doors in the middle of night. If welcomed, she leaves peacefully. If not given hospitality, she curses the homeowners in bizarre ways, such as 'you’ll be a beast and your family will be turned into cutlery until someone falls in love with you.' The peasants are scared of this clearly insane witch wandering the land, and beg the players to stop her.
            The keep was build on top of an old dwarven cemetery. Every new moon, the dead rise and a bunch of short skeletons and ghosts attack the keep cantina. They break barrels of wine and drink the content, devour every plucked chicken and duck in the kitchen and cause mayhem.
            A new group of adventurers has just started their career in town, but they're murderhobos and have been doing a lot of damage.
            Two families have been enemies for generations. The youngest members of the two, young and innocent, had fallen in love, but their families didn't allow them to be together. As a result, they committed suicide together. Then, they came back as undeads and now haunt the lands of their families.
            Two families have been friends for generations, but two of the youngest members, barely adults, hate each other and challenge each other to violent duels. Sooner or later one of them will kill the other, or they could both die, and nobody wants that to happen
            A local mafia has been asking the locals to pay protection money and attacking the people that refuse. Problem is, the mafia actually does protect the people, and their private militia is pretty efficient. A lot of locals support them.
            A nearby goblin tribe has been encroaching on the players land. The goblins seem to be running away from something, but the farmers don't care. They just want the monsters out of their land.
            A nearby goblin tribe has been encroaching on the players land. The goblins seem to be running towards something, in a violent frenzy, trampling over any obstacle, as if attracted by a siren's call that nobody else hears.
            A nearby goblin tribe has been encroaching on the players land. The goblins say they were promised a portion of land by the previous lord, in exchange for 20 barrels of a rare goblin ale.
            Local sheep have gained sentience and refuse to be raised like animals. They have organized themselves in a commune and demand more rights and their own land where they can live in peace.
            There is a cave below the keep where enormous fungi grow. One day, they start growing outside, covering the keep walls and doors, infecting trees and animals.
            A group of devils appears in the backyard, they start taking measurements of the keep. When confronted, they say that the land belongs to them. They have a contract: The land was sold to them ten thousand years before, by the people owning it back then. From their point of view, it’s legally theirs, and the players have ten minutes to screw off before they get evicted.
            A drunken giant walks by, stumbling in confusion. He crawls inside the keep and falls asleep in the courtyard, blocking it.
            Three hundred years ago, a great hero was born in the keep, and pilgrims come from all over to visit. They don’t care for locked doors or local laws, and often they will steal things as souvenirs. Sometimes precious things, but often they will take curtains, pieces of furniture, cutlery, shoes, socks.
            A ghost haunts the castle. He was the castle owner, centuries before. The ghost spends his days getting drunk and harassing people in the open. Shouldn’t he, like, rattle chains and scream in the night? Well, he didn’t get a how-to-ghost pamphlet when he died, so excuse him if he’s not haunting in the 'proper' way. In the end, he’s a friendly guy, just kind of an asshole.
            A summoning went wrong, and the demon spirit got stuck in the piano in the music room. You can play it normally if you’re good, but If you hit the wrong note, the keys will bite your fingers. On a positive note, it never needs tuning. Just to be fed twice a week.
            A summoning went wrong, and a celestial spirit got stuck in a door. Now, it won’t let anyone through unless they prove to be worthy. The door takes its position very seriously and is pretty obnoxious.
            A powerful vampire lived in the castle, centuries ago, but it got destroyed by hunters. Or, nearly destroyed. The vampire is still alive, but it’s only a head, too weak to regenerate. It’s now kept inside a glass casing as decoration on a desk. You can talk with it, it’s a pretty intelligent head. It could, potentially, get its powers back by drinking blood, and tries to trick people into feeding it.
            There is an imposing statue in the courtyard, a hero fighting various monsters. On every full moon night, they animate, the monsters spread around the keep and the hero chases them down.
            There is a deep well in the back of the keep. It’s ancient, and nobody knows how deep it goes. The water in it causes hallucinations
            There is an empty room in the keep. If you try to put furniture in it, as soon as the room is empty, the doors will slam close, then, a terrible grinding sound will come out of it for a few minutes. When it’s done, the doors will open and the room will be empty again.
            There is a tower in the keep that is much older than the rest. The servants are scared of it, they talk of a cloaked figure with a lantern walking around it at night, and strange noises.
            A druid keeps intruding in the garden. He has very strong opinions on how the rest of the garden should be cultivated, the right way to prune, colour-coordination of flowers etc. and will harass and even attack the gardener if they disagree.
            A tree in the garden is inhabited by a dryad. She is extremely charismatic and a lot of peasants are friend with her, she gives advice, healing herbs and concoctions and farming tips. Some are starting to think she would be a pretty good town leader, even better than the players…
            Filth and garbage fall from the sky and over the keep. Half-eaten bones, poop, rotten fruit, it’s gross. Nobody knows where exactly they come from.
            At night, terrifying figures wander the village. They wear animals heads, or maybe they are half-animals, nobody knows but the peasants are terrified.
            A farmer’s field is become sentient and are attacking people. Humanoids made of tangled tomatoes, pumpkins ogres, zucchini knights, cabbage rangers and rice warlocks.
            A bizarre creature appears in the castle, a tangle of feathers and claws, beaks and tails and eggs and horns. It flies around for a while, breaking things and hurting people, then it blinks away and appears in another room, then again and again.
            A section of the castle is on fire, but it doesn’t seem to be spreading.
            There is a door that leads nowhere, it simply has a wall behind it. Sometimes, it opens and people walk out of it, confused foreigners from distant lands. Nobody has ever been able to use it to go back.
            A gang of kids and fairies is going around the village breaking windows, turning carts, liftings skirts and generally being annoying. Nobody has been able to catch them, thanks to the fairies magic.
            A priestess wants to open a chapel in the keep. She is extremely aggressive and self-righteous, but pretty good at divine magic.
            A wizard wants a laboratory in the keep, where nobody’s gonna annoy him about safety regulations or so-called 'crimes against nature', but he can pay very well.
            A neighbouring lord is visiting the keep. The man is wealthy and well-connected. He’s accompanied his daughter, who is independent and rebellious, and wants to become a ranger. The lord would be grateful to anyone that changed his daughter’s mind, and the daughter would be grateful to anyone that helped her escape.
            A neighbouring lord is visiting the keep. The man is too old to care, hates etiquette and loves parties. He’s accompanied his daughter, who hates poor people and fun and wants to uphold traditions. The lord will be grateful to anyone able to make his daughter loosen up, and the daughter will reward anyone that will allow her to replace her dad.
            A neighbouring lord is visiting the keep with his daughter. They are both raging assholes that look at every other person like filth, but they are part of a powerful and connected family.
            A neighbouring lord is visiting the keep with his daughter, they are both party animals with a habit of going too far and causing serious damages and starting fires, but they’re a lot of fun.
            No neighbouring lord is visiting the keep. That is bad for diplomacy, the players need to make their land more appealing, or they won’t be taken seriously and remain isolated.
            A hole opens in the middle of town, and a bunch of drow flood out. They’re refugees, running away from mind flayer slavers. They were forced to escape to the surface or die, and are out of options. If the players don’t shelter them, they will all die. Most of them are civilians. Many peasants are against it, and think its’ a trap, or that they deserve to die. The mind flayers are coming.
            A hole opens in the middle of town, and a bunch of slugs flood out. They crawl over people and bury in their brains. There is panic, but the 'infected' people seem fine, more or less. There is no immediate effect, and nobody is sure who or how many were infected.
            A hole opens in the middle of town and a blinding light floods out. Some people, as in a trance, start walking inside it and never come out. Every day more people go in the hole.
            An artist has settled in the village. Her art pieces are very, very good, but also disturbing, and seem to reveal people’s secret. They cause fights, start feuds and break up families.
            An artist has settled in the village. His art pieces are terrible beyond all comprehension and cause people to get sick and physical pain. After just a few days, some of them animate and turn into hideous monsters. Nobody knows where exactly the artist is hiding.
            A storyteller has arrived in town. He’s extremely charming, even too much: people stop working to listen to his tales, and some become unable to distinguish fiction from reality. Others lock themselves in their rooms, daydreaming, only coming out when a new tale is being told.
            There is a well in the keep, and sometimes coins fly out of it, followed by a voice making a wish. If the wish isn’t fulfilled, more coins arrive, but the voice is angry. Then pebbles start to fly out followed by cursing, eventually it’s rocks, knives and axes, then deadly spells.
            A metallic globe has appeared over the keep. It floats roughly a hundred meters in the air, immobile. Sometimes, it exudes blood that then rains over the keep.
            A couple of tailors arrive in town, they sell an incredibly rare material: an invisible cloth that only smart people can see. It is true, and people with Intelligence over 16 see it. It is very beautiful and comfortable and resilient.
            A woman arrives in town. She appears to be a regular peasant, but she’s very charismatic and starts rallying people to go to a holy war. She is very convinced of herself, and many are ready to follow. If they do, the town will lose a lot of its population and be unable to function, but she’s on a mission for God.
            A group of people that looks identical to the players arrives in town, pretending to be let into their keep. Who are these fools impersonating them, they ask? What trick is this? They demand the players get kicked out. The issue is, these fakes are all smarter and more likeable than the real ones, so many peasants are on their side.
            A servant rushes to the players, covered in sweat. A woman is dying. She overdosed on some weird drugs that a gnome sold them that they were doing together. They’re secretly in a relationship, but she’s the daughter of a nearby nobleman. If she dies or their relationship is revealed, it will be a mess. Her father could very well start a war. He fucked up dude, but they gotta help him, or they’ll all be in troubles.

    moral dillemas
        You finally have the villain at your mercy, but their child is with them. Are you willing to kill an innocent child's parent in front of their very eyes?
        The village is going to be culled to prevent the spread of a terrible plague. Do you spare the villagers by preventing the cull at risk of millions of lives dying to plague?
        The villain has framed you for a crime you didn't commit, but to resist arrest would make it more likely that your reputation as an outlaw sticks with you permanantly. Do you turn yourself in?
        The wizard sent you on a simple errand: decomission his malfunctioning golem, but when you find the golem it is exhibiting obvious signs of sentience, and self awareness. Does it deserve the freedom of other sentient beings?
        The villain shares a common goal/enemy with the party and suggests declaring a truce to deal with the situation. Do you work together with your sworn enemy?
        You captured some enemy soldiers for information and have them at your mercy. Do you let them go and risk them giving away your position or slaughter the unarmed troops? 
        Your party is guilty of a crime (aren’t they all at some point?) and the local law enforcement has arrested someone else for it. Do you turn yourself in and save the person, or do you let them try him so you can remain out of prison?
        Your party is contracted to deal with a group of bandits that has been waylaying merchants on the road, miles outside of town. It turns out that the spoils of these robberies are being redistributed to the poor citizens.

        A bottle of stolen mead has been found by the party after a merchant warns them to be on the lookout for it. However, the rare mead is unattended and probably worth a nice chunk of change. The party can either steal it, sell it, and tell the merchant what they did, lie about stealing it, return it to the merchant, or do nothing. If the party ends up stealing or returning the mead, a later quest will reveal it was honestly bought and that the merchant, now gone, is something of a scammer. 
        You come to a crossroads and suddenly from the north a girl comes running down saying 'please help....they are about to sacrifice my sister' And then a boy comes running up from the other direction 'please help...my village is under attack' Helping the girl stop the sacrifice summons a demon but the sister is saved and the other village is slaughtered. Saving the village means the sister is sacrificed and the girl stalks the party waiting for her moment to strike to get revenge

        The party comes cross an infant gnoll, crying over the corpse of its dead parent. It may be an inherently chaotic and evil creature, but it is still young—do they leave it, kill it, or try to help it? 
        A local mimic wants to stop being used as furniture. Does the party kill it, or take pity and relocate the poor creature 
        The party were the only witnesses to a child stealing something from a stall, but the city punishes stealing with death. If the party doesn't describe (and thus likely condemn) the child to death, the blame will fall on the only other possible thieves: themselves. 
        A local lord and his knights have recently killed an adult dragon which had been terrorizing the surrounding lands for years. There's one last job: go to the dragons lair and exterminate it's clutch of eggs and the remaining wyrmlings. None can survive or the lairs effects on the region will never go away. 
        There's a deadly and neigh-unbreakable curse that jumps from parent to biological child when the parent dies. The current curse bearer is a powerful wizard who keeps it at bay with ritual sacrifice of humanoids, using their souls to empower his resistance. The wizard has many children and dozens of grandchildren, and if he's killed, they'll quickly die from the inherited curse, them lacking his ability to resist it. 
        A senile old wizard has been secluded in the mountains, summoning mass amounts of monsters to keep himself from being lonely. The monsters run away from him out of fear but savagely kill innocents. Does the party kill him to stop the killings or go to the trouble of trying to find help for him. 
        There's a prophecy that a young child, descendant of a great hero, will be the gateway for a great demon to come back into this world by bursting out of the kid's chest. An evil wizard can get the demon out without harming the child, but the demon will be under the wizard's control. Do the heroes wait to see if the prophecy is false (it's not), enlist the help of the wizard and have to deal with that problem later, or murder the great-great-great-great grandchild of the man who saved the entire kingdom?

        A quest to go slay a nearby ogre is posted in a tavern. The ogre has no interest in hurting anyone but doesn't want to leave either. Gemstones poking out of the walls of the caves hint at why the bounty was placed. 
        You are fighting your way to a dragon's lair through some surprisingly smart owl bears, shambling mounds, treants, and other typically dumb creatures. You learn that to destroy the dragon's (or other BBEG) power will be to rob all these creatures of their intelligence that they now prize so dearly. partially based on a post by
        A level in the dungeon is filled with monsters and deadly traps, but also cages filled with innocents in the way. If the party isn't careful they are likely to be killed. 
        The local village is holding a firbolg named Thorbyrn prisoner, saying he killed one of the local guardsmen. The firbolgs have always been peaceful and all evidence suggests he’s not the culprit. He’s to be executed in the morning and the party must decide if they will save him. 
        A village is under the influence of a long forgotten goddess of Fertility who requires blood sacrifices to work her magic. Without the sacrifices, the crops are eaten by pests, die to diseases from the soil, or don't even make enough food for a small child. 
        You've been called to kill a bunch of 'evil' creatures (goblins, orcs, whatever) but find that while they're not the best ever they're also the victims of discrimination and being kept out of 'honest' ways to make a living

Setting builder
    nice book?
        who authored it?
            precursors or the inhabitants of a previous reality.
            the work of a deity, saint or otherwise somehow divine in origin.
            a powerful mage or other form of spell caster.
            an aberration such as a(n)...illithid, aboleth, neogi, beholder.
            an outsider such as a(n)...celestial, fiend, elemental/genie, fae, or someone possessed by one.
            the culmination of the efforts of generations of scholars.
            author was taken by a eerie mood and wrote the work in a fortnight.
            it merely appeared one day, fully formed.
        
        what form does it take?
            tablets made of...stone/clay, metal, wax, wood.
            tome bound in...leather, metal, ivory, loose sheaves.
            scroll crafted of...paper, hides, leaves, cloth.
            graffiti, scrawling or runes etched onto a...structure, natural feature, path or road, cave.
            tangles of intricate ropes and beads in a language that may not still be known. may be read in the dark.
            a puzzle box or similar device. the secrets within are whispered into the mind of those who solve it.
            scrimshawed upon the bones of a(n)...humanoid, outsider, aberration, monster. may be read in the dark.
            woven into the fabric of a(n)...article of clothing, tapestry, blanket/quilt, tent/yurt
        
        what kind of lore is inside?
            the true names of...celestials, fiends, genies, fae.
            exhaustively indexed knowledge on an extremely niche topic such as elven architecture or goblin poetry. worth a small amount to most, but a huge sum to the right collector.
            a creeping form of madness which provides insight into the world. in exchange for losing one's mind permanently, the bearer of the work may ask it questions and gain answers 1d6 times per day as if they were using the spells find the path, augury, identify or clairaudience.
            a compendium covering the habits and weaknesses of...outsiders, aberrations, magical creatures, undead.
            the true and secret history of a...major empire, noble family, trade league, faith/cult.
            prophecies relating to the...end of the world, death of a deity, fall or destruction of a major empire, death of a famous figure, such as a warlord or archmage.
            insight into a complicated and fraught magical process such as...summoning outsiders, alchemy, reviving the dead, creating constructs such as golems.
            detailed accounting ledgers of a...trade league, noble family, guild, town/city council.
        
        is it trapped or have guardians?
            animates a mouth upon its surface and bites those who try to read it without the proper password. 1d6+3 bludgeoning damage. bites again every 2d10 rounds.
            lets out a blood-curdling scream and flies away at 60' turn if read anywhere except...under the stars, within a chamber with no natural light, upon unworked earth, a place of spiritual significance.
            locked. if an attempt is made to force it open it begins to weep gallons upon gallons of...blood, ink, water, ichor.
            the work is a keystone or plug of sorts, if removed or reproduced then...the area containing the work shakes itself to bits in 1d6 minutes, undead begin to appear around where the work is held, animals of all stripes become hostile to whomever bears it, bad luck follows the bearer, the referee may impose disadvantage on 1d2 rolls per day at their discretion.
            a cult or religious order is dedicated to safeguarding the work in some way. if it is stolen of copied without consent then they will surely seek to rectify the situation.
            magically bound to defend the work in some way until their destruction, the guardian takes the form of a(n)...powerful undead creature, outsider, monster, construct.
            only certain type of folk are able to read the work, it is gibberish to everyone but...non-spellcasters, followers of an obscure faith, the mad, someone who has never taken a life.
            the work itself is famous. while there is no one specifically looking for it, the very news of it changing hands may attract unwanted attention to those who now have it.
