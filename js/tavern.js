    let taverns = [
        "The Salty Seafarer - Found moored up at ports around the lands, this floating tavern is always busy, but only for a week or so before it sails off to it's next destination. Who knows when you'll bump into it again! Famed for the owner's stories and fables they have collected on their travels from the tavern's many patrons, as well as world famous bards who often travel along with it. Of course we can't forget to mention the exotic drinks and food they have picked up on the way!", "Nobody's Inn - Entering this tavern, you find that there doesn't seem to be an owner, although there are many patrons, pouring their own drinks and leaving coins in collection trays.", "The Boney Bar - The Boney bar is, if anything, creepier than it sounds. Not only are there skeletons serving you, nearly everything is made out of bones. The tables and chairs, a massive chandelier hanging in the centre of the room... even the mugs are skulls with the holes plugged up! Luckily, the food and drink is exquisite!", "The Dapper Dragon - A fancy restaurant that uses tiny dragons and other creatures to help cook food. Basically Ratatouille but with monsters! If I were you, unless you like your food black, I wouldn't ask for my steak to be 'Well done.'", "Hunter's Rest - Situated in the head of a huge dragon, this extravagant tavern is a place for hunters to show off their kills and share stories of their hunts. They also hold competitions here, as well as hosting a market and trade shows for meats, furs and other materials extracted from their kills. Adorning the walls of the three floors are the heads of all sorts of beasts, ranging from stags and boar to more exotic creatures like Owlbears and Displacer Beasts. There is a leaderboard filled with the top 20 hunter's names and how many points they have for the season.", "The Weather House - The weather inside this place is always different to what it is outside, offering respite if it is particularly hot or cold. Unfortunately the owners were not very specific with the wizard that they got to enchant their tavern, causing it to rain, snow or even hail inside when the weather outside is warm, which isn't great for business, although they do keep a few umbrellas by the front door, so you can stay mostly dry if you decide to stay here.", "Tinsy Winsy Tavern - Sandwiched between two large buildings is a small door leading to a tiny room with one stool in front of a short bar, leaving just enough room behind it for a halfling barkeep.", "The Drunken Dummy - Every night the owner is on stage with his wooden ventriloquist dummy. This thing looks creepy as hell, but they are telling some great jokes and the crowd is eating it all up! The act seems to show they have a complicated relationship, with the dummy regularly shouting down the owner and slapping him. It's a fantastic routine... or so it seems.", "The King's Armistice - This tavern has been untouched by many wars over the years. Said to have been blessed by a mighty wizards final words as he sacrificed himself to end a long and gory war, it is a place to go for some respite during warring times. Upon entering all equipment disappears, including clothing. No magic seems to work either. Of course upon exiting, many people instantly break any truce they previously had, making the surrounding area of this tavern a bit of a wreck.", "The Tinker Inn - As you push the door you hear a mechanical whirring. Looking up you see a clockwork soldier with a big hammer run out of a house and strike a bell, alerting the owner to a new visitor. Dotted around the tavern are all sorts of interesting toys and contraptions. Some are just for aesthetics, like a small hot air balloon flying around the room, but others are actually useful. Little trains run along tracks around the room delivering food and drinks and music is playing from a strange box at the back of the room.", "The Nibbly Fish - Opening the door you realise that nearly the whole floor is lowered and covered in a pool of water about a foot deep. A sign on the door says, 'No shoes!' You take your boots off and step inside, noticing there are tiny colourful goldfish swimming around and nibbling the dead skin off your feet. There's nothing like a free foot pedicure whilst you enjoy a good drink!", "The Cat's Whiskers - Ran by a lovely Tabaxi family, this inn is full of cats of all different breeds. You'll find them napping on beams, weaving in and out of the patrons legs and mewing whilst they wait to be fed. It's a great place to visit if you like milk on tap! (But awful if you're allergic to cats)", "The Costumer's Always Right - There is a bouncer at the door dressed up like a bugbear. He says, 'Hey, no coming in without a costume.' Once dressed up sufficiently you are let inside. You see people dressed up as famous heroes from stories and also as monsters, some of which are real and some are made up. They are all chatting and laughing, pretending to fight and posing for portraits.", "Gravity Falls Tavern - Situated at the base of a waterfall that is actually flowing up the cliff instead of down it, the Gravity Falls Tavern is a sight to behold. It's upside down. Drunk people are exiting, stumbling around as they navigate the stone steps. Entering, you see a chandelier standing upright, 'hanging' from a chain set in the floor. The most amazing thing is that you see people walking and sitting on every single face of this room. Each side of the room seems to have it's own gravity field, including the bar, which is at 90 degrees to what you currently see as the floor. You realise that those people probably weren't drunk, just disorientated from dealing with all the changes in gravity!", "The Roasting Duck - Every night is roast night here at The Roasting Duck! We're not just talking about the food either. Come on in for you and your friends to get a good ol' roasting from our in-house roasters and you can even get up on stage and give it a go. The best roaster every night wins 30gp! Do you have what it takes?", "Firebeard Tavern - At the end of every night the magnificently bearded owner stands up on a table in the middle of the tavern to the cheers of the patrons and sets his beard on fire, keeping it going for as long as he can. During this time drinks are free so the patrons swig as much as they can before he has to pat it out. His record is 4 minutes!", "The Tower - Unlike any tavern you've seen before, this place is about 6 times taller than it is round! Apparently this place used to be connected to a massive castle, but it got destroyed in a great war. With a spiral staircase round the edge and a pole in the middle to slide down, this tavern is certainly a novelty. You notice all the staff members have incredibly strong calf muscles from walking up the steps so much. At the top of the tower is an open top terrace, offering an amazing view out across the surrounding valleys.", "The Grape Escape - An underground winery that stretches for longer than any tavern you've seen before. Like a wine cellar, this place has thousands of bottles in racks and shelves that make up the walls. What sets this apart from other wine cellars is that it is also a maze! Without a guide you are sure to get lost in its winding walls. ", "The Peace & Quiet - A haven for writers and readers alike, this is the quietest tavern/library you've ever seen. Although to be fair, it is the only tavern/library you've ever seen. With three floors of books, comfy seats and desks, this is a great place to relax, or even come for a quick nap... as long as you don't snore. If you're looking for a good book, this is the place to go. There are books on every wall, shelves upon shelves of ordered books and not to mention the staircases with books under every single step! You will be spoilt for choice! However, if you aren't keen on this scene you aren't going to have too much fun. There are alcoholic bevereges, but they are all cocktails themed around book names... (Tequila Mockingbird, Lord of the Gins, etc.) and there is a limit of one per customer to avoid anyone getting too loud.", "The Knife & Pork - With its very own in-house abattoir, feel free to select your favourite from a wide selection of pigs to chow down on this evening. It's the perfect place to be swined and dined! This place is really fancy and looks great from the outside. Everyone is dressed to the nines and are pretty posh. As soon as you enter you hear the squealing of pigs out the back. Likely to be a pretty harrowing experience for you and your party...", "The Amen Arms - The Amen Arms is a multi-use building, being a church and also a bar. The only problem is that they only sell communion wine on tap. Unfortunately this has left the members of the clergy with pretty severe drinking problems, which does liven up Sunday prayers, but isn't so great when the priest is loudly weeping at funerals and weddings.", "Rick Ade Bar - This bar has some of the trippiest drinks you've ever seen! Fizzing potions and steaming cauldrons are on every table and everything is so cheap! As you've had your fill and you go to leave you realise the door has been barricaded and there is no way out. You're told that all the drinks need to go before anyone can leave. Looking around you see there are creatures like Bugbears and Gnolls as well as people of all different races (and classes) around the bar, some not looking overly thrilled that they have to spend the night in this place. You see a fight break out between two clerics, shouting 'Die demon scum! Go back to whence you came!' That's when you feel it start to kick in... What on earth is in these drinks?", "The Stray Fey Inn - This beautiful inn originated from the Feywild. Due to an accident many years ago, this inn and all of its patrons got transported to your plane. Apparently this was a pretty rough area before the inn turned up and they attracted some higher class visitors. No one is quite sure what happened with the inn that was here before, but it is common legend that it was taken to the Feywild with its less-than-savoury patrons so they could try and redeem themselves in a different land.", "The Playhouse - This grand theater has been converted into a dining establishment with live acts. Once a month the Queen visits and judges a talent competition, with the winner taking a spot in the Royal Talent Guild. Members of this guild go to live in the castle grounds, entertaining guests and earning a great salary before being kicked back out into the real world once the Queen has had enough of you. Past members all seem desperate to get back, but most of them fail.", "The Boar Inn - This tavern seems really standard. Just a really old sweet couple who are like 90 years old. Offer tea and coffee and cakes rather than booze. There are those white lacy doilies on the tables and it's just proper classic old person vibe. However, you do notice a dull repetitive thudding through the floorboards. With some investigation you find a bright neon, seizure-inducing underground club. Everyone is covered in glow in the dark patterns. Drink and drugs are in high supply. If you decide to stay you're soon joined by the old couple who properly rave it up. They ask that you do not tell anyone else of their secret club because the nobles wouldn't approve it. In return you get half price food and drink, either upstairs or downstairs.", "Twilight Tussle Inn - Every night at sunset a huge brawl breaks out over the tavern. Once there are x people left, everyone that lost must buy them a drink at some point during the evening. (Replace 'x' with the party size -1 person.) Naturally, the owners have long since stopped buying new glasses, tending to just use stone mugs because they are so much harder to break. They have also had to bolt down all of the tables and chairs to stop them being used as weapons every night. other than that is is pretty much no holds barred, although there will be a severe penalty if you actually kill someone during the tussle.", "The Brushstroke Bed & Breakfast - (BSB&B for short) is an idyllic and luscious establishment with a very special hook. Each rooms door is replaced by a large enchanted painting that creates different scenes to sleep in. Ranging from snugly tropical treehouses and luxurious campsites in the woods to frozen igloos and rocking boats on the sea. This place is sure to have a room for anyone to enjoy... if they have the coin to afford it.", "Fire and Ice Alehouse - This tavern features dueling bars on opposite sides of the room. One side icy and blue tones the other billowing flames and red tones. The two sides come together across the ceiling every hour to make 'fire water' that falls from a swirling cloud in the middle of the room. Fire Water is a delicious drink that also provides its drinker resistance to fire and ice for 24 hours.",
        "The Toil & Trouble - Ran by a Neutral Witch, this place is filled with bad guys nearly 24/7. She doesn't seem to notice or care about anyone's alignments or what they get up to, unless there is any violence. If anyone causes a scene she descends on them, leaves them within an inch of their lives and bans them for life. If anyone tries to return, even in disguise, she knows and instantly kills them. She has no time for people that want to cause problems in her domain.", "The Rickety Witch - There aren't actually any witches in this bar, but the servers float around on brooms and are dressed up as them. The food is all themed around ingredients in potions. Rat tails, eyes of creatures, etc. Surprisingly tasty!", "The Dark Horse - This tavern is in complete darkness and any attempt to create a light either by magical or non-magical methods will fail. The staff all wear special goggles that allow them to see whilst serving tables and dealing with customers. It is billed as a unique experience to tantalise your senses, but in reality the owner is a once beautiful sorceress that has been horrifically disfigured by a curse and she hates being seen. She may employ the party to help lift the curse and in return offer them the tavern, which they can design however they wish.", "The Bam & Booze - The best way to describe this place is... confusing. The first thing you need to do is figure out how to get in! The door doesn't seem to open in the normal way. Do you try and go through a window? Down the chimney? Maybe there's a key hidden somewhere? It gets even more confusing once you get inside. All of the drinks are FREE! (As long as you can solve the puzzles the owner puts before you. Some may be in a different room of the tavern, whereas others could be simple riddles. Now you've had your fill and are ready to leave, how do you get out? Uh oh. It's a huge escape room! (I feel like this one will be really fun to flesh out for a DM!)", "Oasis - Stumbling through the desert you happen upon a large tent with camels tied up outside. Inside is a luxury bar with expensive drinks and attractive women. People are sitting around in beanbags, smoking who knows what from hookahs. Smells of delicious exotic foods are wafting through the air. It's very inviting. I'll let you DMs decide how real this place is! It could either be a mirage and not exist at all, a crappy little tent with horrible drinks under a major illusion or exactly as described. How evil are you feeling?", "The Meteorite Meat Shack - Located at the bottom of a huge impact crater from a meteorite, this self sustaining tavern is attached to a huge farm. Apparently the soil in the bottom of the crater is particularly fertile, leading to stronger crops and livestock! If your players do some investigating they will find out that the meteorite is still around, with a barn built around it in the dead centre of the crater. Of course it is the source of the mysteriously good crops and livestock. All it needs is a human blood sacrifice once a week...", "Cheep & Cheerful - A tavern filled with colourful birds of all different species flying around and perching on beams above you. You can buy seeds to feed the birds if you are so inclined. (They are also less likely to try and eat your dinner if you feed them!). No Cats or Tabaxi allowed.", "Hear Here! - Live music, 24/7, featuring all your favourite artists and bands; Coldflay, Goblin Manuel Miranda, Armour Class/Difficulty Class, Owlbear City, Bulette Zeppelin and more! (5gp entry)", "Muscles & Cockles - The only restaurant where you can pump iron and pump beer, from a tap. The beer, not the iron. The stronger you are, the heavier your discount. Upon entering you must perform a feat of strength, such as hitting a button with a mallet to try and ding the bell at the top or lifting something heavy, like barrels of beer or a rotund gentleman.", "The Holey Grail - Named after a grail that has been pierced hundreds of times, be it from arrows, explosions or a multitude of other things. Every night the tavern owners hold a contest to see who can create the most holes when it is tossed in the air. After 12 hours the grail has mysteriously repaired itself. (You could make this a magical item or simply have the owners replace it with a new one every day)", "Love Me Knot - This tavern is placed right there on the beach. But, oh no, the tides coming in! Never fear, the Love Me Knot floats and is tied down to heavy anchors beneath the sea floor to stop it from drifting away. Of course it still seems to move around the beach every other week to find a nice spot in the sun.", "Grogchamp - Winner of finest Grog 3 years straight, you'd be hard pressed to find a finer drink. However, the brewer is letting all the fame get to his head and is getting rather arrogant, challenging all around to try and create a better beverage. Are your party up to the task?", "The Leeky Crockpot - Everything is... leeky. Like, based on leeks. Leeks on your food, leeks used as stirrers in your drinks. There are even leeks on the beds! Where are all these leeks coming from? Now you smell like leeks. You scrub and you scrub, but still, the leeky reek remains. If your adventurers get a bed here for the night they take a charisma hit to all except those who love leeks, in which case they get a bonus.", "The Troll Booth - Simply pay your fee to cross the bridge and there surely won't be any trouble. They'll even throw in a hot cup of tea or coffee to make it worth your while. The trolls found that they were getting a lot higher return when they moved over to the service industry instead of the... ambush industry?", "Rise and Shine - You arrive at the tavern after a hard day's dungeon diving, just to find it is shut. Looking at the opening hours you see it is open from 6AM-7AM. Who on earth is drinking at 6 in the morning?? If they go during open hours they find it is absolutely heaving with customers, drunkards stumbling out after being in there for just a few minutes. Whilst inside you notice time is so much slower too. It will feel like hours pass whilst inside, even if you're only in there for 10 minutes of real time. (Maximum 12 hours in the 1 hour it's open, so 10 minutes real time would be 2 hours drinking time, for example)", "Above Par - Err, drinking and mini-golf? Yes please! A hole-in-one on the final hole wins you a free drink at the bar. Just be careful though, the more you drink, the harder it is to aim! (You may also refer to this place as 'The Golf Club')", "Beat it - As you enter you must play a tune on a drum kit. If you play it well everyone cheers, but if it's bad they will boo and jeer. If you refuse to play or roll a nat 1, you can't enter. If you roll a nat 20 you get a free beer or some other prize.", "Climber's Paradise - The only thing between you and a cold glass of ale is this 100-foot climbing wall.", "Paradice - Yes, Paradice. This club is so exclusive, you can only get in if you hit a DC20 Charisma check.", "Rambler's Gamble - Among the hills and slopes of this region rests an inn. An inn owned by a being addicted to gambling. Any travelers passing by may be tempted to enter for a refreshing drink and a hot meal, but they will find no prices on the menu. Maybe they would like to wager something for it instead?", "Gob Site - A wooden construct, stuck together with mud and held up with thin ropes, this absolute dive of a bar isn't somewhere you would choose to go, even in a pinch. A Goblin ran establishment, serving Goblins and ONLY Goblins... Unless you have something to make it worth their while.",

Half-Orc or...is that a baby?", "While normal appearing from the outside, inside the bar and tables are all moulded from one tree, which is rooted in the bar and has carefully been bent and flattened over hundreds of years to serve as a bar and tables. The tree is still alive and growing, with a leaf sprouting here and there.", "The entire tavern is curiously dusty, despite being well attended, some areas look like they have a decade of dust upon them. If dust is swept off an empty table, all regulars will groan, and a large number of days written in chalk on the bar will be wiped off.", "The mugs are enchanted to refill themselves when you snap your fingers. You still get charged for the refills though.", "The tavern is a renovated monastery. The grounds were hallowed such that the entire area is magically silent. Patrons come from near and far for the extraordinary peace and quiet it offers.

Any adventurer that feeds it a piece of meat will find that the dog will make its way outside toward a treasure chest hidden in the dirt outside.", "A tavern tucked away in one of the hottest regions of Avernus. It’s name is the Icebox, and it is owned by a devil who has bound an ice elemental into eternal servitude. This tavern has a fireplace containing a magical blue flame that radiates cold, rather than heat. This same blue flame is also behind the bar, beneath an iron grate upon which several mugs sit. This keeps them frosty cold, and makes this tavern an area favorite. Devils like to visit here for a change of scenery.", "A coastal tavern built from a kraken’s skull. It’ s name is The Little Fish. This tavern is frequented by wild storytellers, who tell the truth about 25 % of the time.", "A 2-story tavern with a strange reputation, where patrons must pay a steep fee up front before entering. Once inside, players will see a strange black liquid dripping from several holes in the ceiling, which is being collected in large barrels beneath them. Patrons dip their mugs into these barrels and drink the liquid, which is delicious and quite intoxicating. Rumor has it that this liquid is the blood of a demon who is imprisoned upstairs. No one is allowed upstairs to find out.", "A tavern called 'The View' built right next to a beautiful but very loud waterfall. The tavern owner thought it was a smart business move to build next to the waterfall, but you can barely hear anything inside over the roar of the waterfall only meters away from the front door.", "All patrons must check their weapons at the door of this tavern, much like a coat check. You are given a numbered ticket and the weapon is stored away in a back room behind a curtain. Unbeknownst to the players, this tavern is notorious for 'accidentally' replacing high quality or magical weapons that have been checked with inferior duplicates.", "All the food and drink have a slightly off taste. Not to the point of inedibility, but enough to notice something's off about it. When asked the bartender just smiles and says everything's spiced with a 'special ingredient' here. An investigation will reveal the barkeep raises snails and uses their slime as a staple ingredient in all of the food. He uses the slime from his favorite snails for his regulars.", "The ceiling of the tavern is very high up, and rather than walk around the tables servers descend from above in a complicated harness system. Sometimes, when nobody's looking, a hook will descend and pull up especially drunk patrons.", "The owner/bartender was a merchant for many years and can't reset a good haggle. A large chalkboard behind the bar displays a list of the lowest prices customers have managed to get out of him this evening, complete with a chalk portrait of the current #1 cheapskate.", "Each table is attached to a little boat that floats down a man-made underground water course. Patrons are offered the choice between the tunnel of love or the waterfall course at the entrance.", "A strange tavern that appears only in the most remote places. Wanderers May enter and find other adventurers from far off places just as confused as they are. There is no tavern keeper but hot food and drink is ready on the tables and the kitchen is open for those who cook. The upstairs rooms have comfy beds with silk sheets and fur blankets.The strangers are allowed one night to rest and feast with one another as they tell tales of their adventures and the bizarre places they’ve found the tavern. Come morning the party will awaken in a clearing where the tavern once stood. The strangers are gone and they are all awaken clean and refreshed.", "One of the servers looks a bit like a monkey, their arms dragging on the floor. On closer inspection... She is a monkey. You might not always get exactly what you ordered, but if you dare complain this monkey will show their teeth, and you really don't want to fight her.", "This tavern is completely made out of ice.

Speak the command word again to revert back to instrument.`, `The Phomenflumphen: You’re not sure what this is. It appears to be equal parts accordion, bagpipe and drum. The Gnome playing it seems to know what they’re doing though. Without training, all checks with this bizarre instrument are made at disadvantage.`, `A conductor’s baton that allows you to shift the pitch of someone talking to make it sound musical.`, `Cetacean Song – An ocarina seemingly crafted from snowflake obsidian that produces some decently low notes, and is shaped somewhat like an aquatic animal of some sort (inspired by this)`, `Conductor’s Instrumental – At first glance, it just looks like a typical conductor’s baton. However, depending on the direction and speed it is moved, it will softly hum a note.`, `Hidden Headbanger – It doesn’t look like too much, just a simple polished wooden 6-string guitar.

When held to the mouth, the rest of the flute is revealed. It’s ghostly blue and produces sweet but strangely sad notes.`, `A small flute carved from bone.

After attunement, when the phrase ‘Spoonblades, to my aid!’ is called within a 15-foot area, the spoons transform into two spoon-shaped shortswords (Treat as a +1 weapon).`, `A set of four elderwood carved string instruments: The Shining Violin, The Viola Melodious, The Morning Cello, and The Bass Sonorous. The four instruments have a deep amethyst luster, and golden inscriptions in an elvish script. The inscriptions tell of a tryst between the God of Forest, and the Mountain Goddess.

As long as the bard is playing the creatures of the deep show now interest in attacking the ship, an aft wind drives the ship forward and rogue waves lose most of their power before hitting the ship. When the music ends the effect slowly wears off and things return to normal over the next 30 minutes.`, `An ancient set of pipes made from the hollowed out finger bones of a dead bard, with his soul still bound to them. When music is played from the instrument, listeners can faintly make out a gentle vocal accompaniment that perfectly fits whatever is being played.`, `A wooden, roughly carved hunting horn that still has patches of bark remaining on its surface. The deep, haunting sound it makes is dark, foreboding, and above all else, wild, with its notes echoing far longer than they should. Once per week, the player of the pipes may use their action to mark a creature. At the start of the player’s next turn, a pack of 2d4 spectral wolves coalesce into being near them and begin to hound the marked creature. The wolves pursue and attack the marked creature relentlessly, being completely immune to mental manipulation of any kind, and otherwise have the same stats as regular wolves. If a spectral wolf dies, it dissipates into the air for 24 hours, after which it reassembles itself within 100 feet of the target and continues its hunt. This effect persists until the marked creature dies or a week has passed, at which point the wolves give a final howl before evaporating and returning to the hunting horn, eagerly awaiting their next prey.`, `An intelligent banjo of common, almost aggressively average craft.

As an action once per rest, a bard can play the Paltry Psaltery and force all enemies he sees to make a Charisma save (DC 10+ the Bard’s performance modifier) or be subjected to the effects of the Bane spell. The effect lasts for as long as the bard plays, plus 1d6 rounds.`, `Old Man’s Shawm- This otherwise nondescript brown shawm has three wrinkled old faces carved into the bell.

Anyone hearing the resultant music for one full round must make a constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.`, `A small drum with a symbol etched on the skin. Closer inspection reveals that the symbol is in fact a tattoo denoting membership to a now-defunct bandit group. (Things did not end well!)`, `An ocarina made out of a large beetle exoskeleton. The sound is not dissimilar to a cricket’s chirp.`, `A 2-meter long string instrument with a thin slate body and metal strings (4 of them). Easy to play and far more durable than it looks.

When swung it makes whistling sounds of different pitch – depending on the speed and direction of the swing.`, `A didgeridoo. Spiraling around it’s length is an epic saga of a great war from history, but key details are false including the victors.`, `A shamisen that has leaves growing out of the tuning pegs. If removed, they grow back very quickly.`, `An aged fiddle made of bits and junk, the finish is patchy and the pegs might even be bits of hardened cork, but an upbeat tune played on this fiddle never fails to get people wiggling fingers and doing a jig. If the listeners resist, they make a Charisma saving throw and dance uncontrollably for 1 minute on a failed save.`, `A white Japanese-style flute delicately inlaid with strange runes of blue-black metal. Close examination will reveal that the flute is carved from a human femur. It always sounds beautiful, but breathtakingly mournful.`, `An old and damaged wooden flute, held together with bandages.

It produces surprisingly beautiful music considering its condition.`, `Bamboongos: A set of bongos made outta bamboo, that when played, summons 1d4 musicians that will give advantage to any bard song or inspiration.

When played, the leaves fall off every tree within a 100′ radius.`, `The squire’s hurdy-gurdy: the soul of the squire who last owned this instrument is bound to it.

It re-tunes itself on clear nights.`, `A lyre that suspiciously resembles the description of one belonging to a certain sun god. It seems to glow with radiance when played. Creatures associated with the moon visibly cringe when they see it, as if they do not like the thought of it’s existence.`, `A hurdy-gurdy made from darkwood, with enchanted strings that produce illusions while being played. The illusions are clearly illusions, and won’t trick anybody, but are entertaining nonetheless. The form of the illusions range from a tiny ship sailing across a wall, to sapling growing out of the floor. The illusions are always transparent to an extent, and appear almost holographic.`, `The Phoenix Egg – A beautifully constructed Red xun, said to be made from the egg of a Phoenix. It is said that, if it is played correctly, it will restore those who die around it to life (mimicking the effect of the revivify spell).`, `An Upright piano that is actually a highly mobile construct built with adjustable legs to be able to move in different terrain. If the piano is played badly or a less than favorable song is played then the constructs personality will take over and it will slam the lid shut, possibly on the musician’s fingers.`, `A string instrument created by and for Elven musicians. The strings are made of specialized bowstring. When they are plucked in the right way they can shoot an ethereal arrow, which deals sonic damage and leaves a ringing in the targets ears.`, `The Dragpipes: A set of bagpipes where the bag itself resembles a dragon’s skull. The horns are exaggerated to form the reeds while the player blows through the mouthpiece connected to the back of the neck. The sound of the Dragpipes mimics the roars of different dragons so the player can convince or cause frightening presence to people making them think there is one, or many dragons.`, `The Barbarian’s Cello: A cello carved from ironwood by dwarves.

It is inscribed with the words ‘take me up’.`, `Fairy Bell: A tiny bell (not fairy-tiny, but regular human tiny) formed from silver and bronze. It has three icons on it. The longer it is rung in rhythm, the more cumulative the effect.`, `Harp of Hades: Necromantic magic flows off this instrument. Though it looks like any angelic harp, its music has been known to drive people to depression, sorrow, and madness. Any necromantic magic in the area increases in potency. Those unfortunate to hear its song are likely to see visions of horrifying events that they never knew about, such as the murder of a loved one that was disguised as a natural death or a repressed memory.`, `Marimba of the Wind: Under each tone bar is a secret compartment, perfect for a rogue to hide things. It also seems to bring impossible good luck to the player, though this cannot be proven.`, `The Triangle: If arcane words are invoked (which can be seen inscribed on the triangle if exposed to temperatures either hot or cold strong enough to kill a man), the center of the triangle becomes an invisible dimensional portal, like a bag of holding.`, `Organ of the Dreaming Land: When played, the nearest sleeping person will begin dreaming of the circumstances around the player. It cannot be played by anyone not of noble birth.`, `Drum, That Which Calls Thunder: A drum of unknown origin. It appears to be made from traditional methods, with clay and perhaps crocodile skin. But there is something more ancient about this drum that you can’t quite put your finger on.

Believed to have belonged to Guit Prox, the ancient Minotaur sage of lore.`, `The Bann’s Fiddle – A light green Fiddle with a bow like a sapling, it is impossible to play the Bann’s Fiddle sadly. Every song has an upbeat, cheery tone. When sad songs are sung on the fiddle, there is a strange magic that turns them happy by the end, resulting in a strange retelling of many tragic sagas.`, `Red Chuk – A small red box with a wooden handle, the Red Chuk creates an impressive percussive sound when struck. Anyone playing has advantage on any persuasion or performance check to act in accordance with courtly formalities for the next hour.`,

Traditionally, the climactic final battle scene is punctuated by the beat of a hammer on an anvil, representing Grefedd’s smashing of Nwalcamun while under attack by a drow army.", "‘The Green Eyes of Mallistari’ – The wooing song of a human woodsman for a half-elven maiden ‘met in a shady glade.’ The song is notable for a memorable bridge, often used when teaching the lute.", "‘Ga-Grosh For-Thaash’ – A song adapted from an Orcish marching anthem, useful for learning the rudiments of Orcish.", "‘The Oysters of Miss Marchelle’ – A sea shanty, recounting the joys of stopping in port at an establishment called ‘Harbor Belle.’ The song declares that ‘no sailor can resist the delight of the oysters of Miss Marchelle.’ The shanty, unlike many such songs, is not clearly innuendo, although it certainly may be (and many sailors sing it as such).", "‘Arnash Quadmatter’ – A song mocking the quintessential absent-minded wizard, referring to the foibles caused by having ‘his nose in a book, a book, a book…’", "‘The Missing Child’ – A mournful Elven song about a mother looking for her lost child, eventually going mad with grief and drowning herself, only to rise again as a banshee." < "‘Grandma Got Eaten By An Owlbear’ – A Popular song in winter months reminding people that they shouldent allow their elderly ex adventuring grandmother to attempt to wrestle monstrosities.", "‘You Can Just Call Me The Gnome’ – A fast-paced, silly song telling the increasing exploits of Hamish McTamish, a fictional gnome adventurer. Each time the chorus is sung, Hamish’s name is lengthened with more titles (the last chorus includes as many silly titles as the singer can think of and can sing in a single breath) followed by ‘but you can just call me the Gnome!’ Although believed to be human in origin, gnomes love the song, and an informal competition has sprung up as to the longest final chorus. The current record belongs to Sprigvill Gaudynack, who (via both her own talent and magical augmentation) kept the last chorus going for three and a half minutes.", "‘Callaud’s Pre-funeral Dance’ – A sprightly instrumental air for country dances. If played with a performance check DC 18 or higher, it functions like ‘Otto’s Irresistible Dance’ for anyone not in combat or threatened (i.e. it will make listening townsfolk break out into dance, but not if you are in the midst of robbing their homes).", "‘Long, Gone Galangal’ – A love story told through Gamelan music about an adventurous Chef seeking a rare root in the forest.

Not much going on and curtains all down. I came across a smokey tavern.

That adventurous bard made it back to the surface, but not understanding the dialect of the deep, transposed the lullaby into a few other chords and added an improvisational lick of their own. That was a thousand years ago, and people have been humming and playing the tune up here ever since then, 50 generations later.", "‘Health Potion #9’ – A song about a long-suffering herbalist companion to a luckless knight and the scrapes the two of them get into.

The crackling blue sparkle and the jet of icy breath you have for rest of the day is worth the expense.", "Weatherbee’s Whirler – Invented by the perhaps too inventive Filbus Weatherbee, this drink is testimony as to why it is a bad idea to point a gnome’s sharp mind towards the creation of a new brew. After spending many years living among the dwarves, Weatherbee made his way home with a drink even the stout folk couldn’ t handle. This monstrosity is laced with latent magic designed to lessen the chance of drinkers dying from its ungodly alcohol content, and reportedly tastes like 'A kick in the face from a horse.' After one shot of this drink, the drinker is shunted into a chaotic haze of blurry awareness, bolstered confidence, and overpowering drunkenness. In addition, the latent magic in the brew causes minor, uncontrolled magical effects to occur around the drinker at random times during the haze. The nature of these effects is up to either the DM or the player, so long as the effects are sufficiently insignificant. After 1d4 hours, the haze drops away and the drinker immediately and almost violently falls into a deep sleep so that they may recover.", "Dragonborn Bloodwine – When you drink it, you are able to use a breath attack once within the next 10 minutes.", "The Quieker – nasty rum that gives a high pitched voice for 1d4 hours.", "Faerie Fireball – a delicious cinnamon whiskey made with a touch of Fey magic.

After drinking it the person seems frozen for a few seconds, but to the person who gulpes it down it feels like days, weeks, maybe even months of 9 different experiences, all basically a form of torture. Often used as a torture method but sometimes drunk to prove ones mental strength, as those that can’ t endure it go insane. The niner is a rare drink because it’s extremely hard to make.

            "Stranger's Heart - Made from leaves of the Succubus Kiss, a parasitic red vine with lip shaped leaves that wraps around young trees, this bitter tea makes you feel in love for a few minutes but with no one in particular. Can be addictive for some people.", "Mountain Fire - Made from Scorched Berries that grown at the base of some volcanoes. The berries are poisonous but once boiled and then dried they can be turned into a spicy drink that fills you with warmth and releases tensions in the body. Drinking more then one cup might make you sweat profusely.", "Morning Sun - Made traditionally from a mix of orange peels and Croissant Lotus petals by monks of the Zenchu River, this bittersweet infusion helps with morning grogginess and giving a productive an early start. Also helps to resist sleep spells.", "Gundyr's Ice Breaker - A bestseller during flu season, this algae based infusion has a strong salty taste but will clear your airways in minutes. Despite it's usefulness, only few people would risk collecting the Ice Grappler Algea that grow under the ice of frozen lakes. Gundyr is on of them.", "Sharp Moonlight - A tea made from the petals of a flower (from a cactus) that blooms only under the moonlight. The leaves must be harvested and processed before the morning, when the petals will, if left to their own, have all wilted. In small amount, Sharp Moonlight helps people sleep, but larger doses can produce hallucinogenic dreams. Many report feeling as if they were one with the moon themselves.", "Khârt (pronounced Curt with a hard c) - A dwarven tea made from the Khyr fungus, which only grows deep underground and physically resembles the black truffle. The tea possesses a bitter, spicy, and pungent aroma and is a potent stimulant, with its precise effects varying depending on method of preparation and the precise provenance of the khyr. The most commonly found type has the khyr being finely minced, dried, and pressed into bricks for easier storage and transport. This tea instills alertness and creativity with a slight sense of euphoria, making it a prized commodity amongst wizards, philosophers, and courtiers in many lands (albeit most prefer to add other things to mask the taste), and a major dwarven trade good.", "Forge-Fire - Whilst Khârt is a common beverage with not very much cultural significance to the dwarves, forge-fire is a brew steeped in ceremony, and it is only consumed by dwarven masters of a craft before undertaking a great endeavor, whether it be a warrior leading a charge against an enemy army, a runeworker making a gate impervious to ram or explosive, or a smith forging the armor of a king. The khyr used in forge-fire is of the highest quality, and the most prized for forge-fire is khyr found growing upon the graves of a dwarf's ancestors or prior masters of the art, as the dwarves believe those specific fungi are gifts from the ancestors and hold some of their skill. Forge-fire is prepared by the drinker in a ritual that takes around 6 hours, during which the dwarf meditates on their ancestors, their training and knowledge, and the magnitude of the task ahead. The tea itself is prepared rather strangely: the khyr is finely sliced and placed into a wide and shallow bowl (often an ornate heirloom) and over it is poured strong mushroom brandy. The mixture is set alight and the heat from the burning, along with the tincturing from the alcohol, produce the infusion. A final incantation is sung and the brew is drunk whilst it is still burning. The brew fills the user with single-minded focus and vigor, making their movements swift, sure, and tireless, with many under its effects being known to work without stopping for days or even weeks. However, the aftereffects are extremely unpleasant, almost as if their life energy itself has burned up, and often leave the dwarf bedridden for months, and those who have consumed it claim to have felt that they utterly lost themselves in the chorus of ancestors and the purity of the craft, . In all dwarven history, few have consumed the forge's flame thrice, and none have survived it.", "Corpses Caffeine - Made from the petals of a corpse flower. When crushed they can be turned into an orange paste that can be infused in hot water to make a bitter but smooth tea. This tea makes you more aware of dead organisms near you.", "Nature’s wake - Made from an old ritual flower used by Druid’s to talk to nature. The petals of this flower are a bright and luminous white but, when dropped in boiling water, the liquid turns black with patches of green. Stir for 10 minutes and drink in one sip is the recommended brewing and drinking time. If brewed and drank correctly, nature will keep you safe for 24 hours. Examples of this would be nature guiding you out of a forest, trees protecting you like a shield.", "Leafwalker's Sensation - Crushed and dried leaves and sprigs from a Dryad's very own branches. The taste isn't different from other green teas, but it's magical warmth will flood inside your throat and belly. If the ingredients were gifted from a dryad, this tea will nourish and soothe to your inner core -mind, body and soul- and awakens your connection to the Fey for a short while. Just don't drink any that was harvested from a dead or unwilling Dryad...", "Dragon’s Balm - Sometimes chewed, this spiky leaf is known to any wood-witch or hermit worth their salt - a common sight among roadside plants and overgrown gardens. When brewed the leaf gives off a strong smoky aroma - drinking it makes your breath smell slightly of woodsmoke and brimstone. The short term effects are as a mild stimulant - a particularly potent brew might help someone work tirelessly for several hours or walk twice as far in a day. Those under its effects seem artificially chipper and may talk more than they mean to. The aftereffects are marked; a mild and not unpleasant lethargy usually followed by a deep and untroubled sleep. Valued by travelers and those living in peaceful locales for its use in travel and ease in ensuring a full night’s rest, the wise avoid its use when danger looms or work must continue at great length - the sleep of Dragon's Balm is difficult to rouse from and the lethargy lasts until the body is allowed to completely rest. Repeated use runs the risk of dependence, and the tea will begin staining the teeth orange over time.", "Ghostflower Tea - Used by mediums and those who wish to commune with the dead - this tea must be prepared in a special ritual lasting an hour. The ritual involves selecting the proper leaves and bulbs from this unassuming but rare white-gold flower and painstakingly removing the tiny black pods that spread from the flower’s open bell. Each pod must be shucked and its contents ground, but when the tea is finally imbibed the user can interact with and speak to the dead. The imbiber will be wreathed in a soft glow for the duration, and appear translucent under moonlight. Given a strong enough dose, they will be able to pass through flimsier solid objects - this effect is rare and taking too much Ghostflower tea is dangerous. The dead become attracted to those who drink this tea; an unlucky medium may drink to speak to a lost loved one or question a murder victim or ancient lord only to find themselves the focus of every unquiet dead or revenant for miles around. Drinking poorly prepared tea or drinking two doses in a single changing of the moon (a month) can give the imbiber intense visual hallucinations and make them violently ill; they have been known to speak at length to visions of their dead loved ones or ancestors and carry out battles against imaginary foes. The skin of a victim of Ghostflower poisoning will be pale and flushed; the blood will not clot and they bleed freely. Those with weak constitutions may perish. Individuals who die while under the effects of ghost flower tea are more likely to become spirits themselves.", "Moon Tea - Brewed by witches, midwives, queens and bachelors - this tea is from an uncommon leafy plant of green-grey leaves. Bitter smelling but sweet on the tongue, having two cups of this at most an hour before coitus will prevent pregnancy. Some claim it heightens sensation and others that it ages the body, but when taken by any sex its efficacy is renowned. Babies born from unions where one or both parent take this tea are considered lucky by many, and the child of such a union is often marked by green flecks in their eyes. This plant is harvested so regularly that what was once a common sight in every garden and back patio has become a valuable commodity; this is because improper harvesting yields sufficient quantities for a dose while killing this fragile plant.", "Willwillown - a common long leaf tea that grows on hillsides and is hardy. Usually drunk as a before midday tea but has several flavored varieties by mixing it with florals like Rill or Munlack or Pepper Flower, or with citrus peels. Gnomes like it baked rather than air dried as it rounds out the body, but they also brew it strong and tanneny which others find unpleasant. Dwarves will sometimes chew Willwillown berries but humans find them bitter and unpalatable.", "Moradin's Loose Leaf - Made from the leaves of Ironwood and a proprietary blend of black tea leaves steeped in a forge's quenching bucket. Gives the drinker renewed vigor to continue hammering, bending and cutting long past many of the younger dwarves.", "Avlat - Made from leaves of a vine that grows wild in poor soil. Brews a peppery, copper-colored tea that is a bit of an acquired taste, but often is used to accentuate other bold flavors, such as those found in rich wines, sauces, and ales.", "Beorunna's Cure-All Named, oddly enough, for a legendary barbarian queen credited with its discovery, this bitter-tasting tea made from boiled stems located in the Savage Frontier has taken on an austere reputation among healers and herbalists. The first time a creature that consumes this tea regains hit points from any source in the following hour, they regain 2d4 additional hit points.", "Blackthorn - Brewed from the leaves of the blackthorn shrub, producing a savory tea with earthy woody notes, and a fruity, tangy aftertaste. This tea is known to calm an upset stomach, and is remarkably common in the Dragon Coast and Dragon Reach.", "Blueleaf - Harvested from the leaves of the bitterhedge plant, plentiful throughout the Realms and used to ward off common crop parasites. When brewed, creates an off-blue tea that is slightly sweet with an almost minty aftertaste. Many enjoy this tea recreationally, though used medicinally it suppresses nausea and dysentery for 8 hours after consumption.", "Chalthorn - Made from grey, furry weeds that plague farmers in Sembia and the Dalelands, this cloudy tea has a dry, chalky taste that is difficult to like. However, when a creature drinks this tea, it becomes unable to taste spice in food for one hour, rendering the most spicy of cuisine palatable.", "Coffee - A potent drink with a bold, robust yet bitter flavor, energizing to those that drink it. A creature cannot sleep or be put to sleep by any means for an hour after drinking coffee.", "Coffee, Dwarvish - A thick, sluggish liquid, almost syrupy in texture and black as midnight. It is doubtful if any actual coffee beans are involved. For 8 hours after drinking dwarvish coffee, a creature cannot sleep or be put to sleep by any means.", "Earth Dragon's Eye - A rich black tea from Shou Lung in Kara-Tur, slightly acerbic, with a complex earthy aroma. Drinking this tea refreshes you and loosens your muscles, increasing your land movement speed by 5 feet for the next hour.", "Elkammat - Brewed from groundnut husks found in Murghôm, Semphar, Mulhorand, Unther, and Chondath, this brown tea has a woody, bitter, and slightly nutty flavor. Typically served spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, or more esoteric spices, this tea warms the heart and engenders positive feelings in those who drink it. The drink of choice for the entire eastern Inner Sea.", "Feverbalm - This tea is brewed from small multi-colored red, black, and yellow flowers found in the Savage Frontier. Drinking this tea calms the mind and numbs the throat and tongue, suppressing any madness effects the character suffers for one hour.", "Gaeth'ad - A tea brewed by the orcs of the Shadow Marches, tasting thick and brackish, with a flavor that stays on the tongue. A versatile if incredibly pungent drink, it can be  brewed as a mild stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic, depending on methods used when brewing.", "Jethur - Purplish and (usually) as savory as broth, this tea is made from dense clusters of fungi known as carpet mushrooms. The taste of this tea is known to shift as one drinks it, and it is renowned by merchants for its ability to induce sobriety and soothe digestion. A creature that drinks this tea suppresses the effects of any alcohol in their system for 2 hours.", "Long Jing - A rich and fragrant green tea, grown in Kara-Tur’s Zhejiang province. Tradition holds that this tea can help cleanse the body of toxins, granting a creature that drinks it resistance to poison damage for one hour after consumption.", "Mallow - This light blue floral tea is popular in Maztica, often finding use as a sleep aid. It carries a light semi-sweet taste. If a creature drinks this tea before sleeping, they sleep free of nightmares and cannot be affected by the dream spell or similar abilities.", "Meiriath - A rich copper-colored beverage tasting of mango and citrus, popular with wealthy residents of Halruaa, Unther, and Mulhorand. Made from carefully-dried leaves of cave-sedge, a grass-like plant that grows in caves and other dark places.", "Mother's Leaf - A mellowing concoction, carrying with it strong grass and sage notes, a staple of healers in the Savage Frontier. If a creature that drinks this tea suffers from any diseases, they can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 13. On a success, one disease the creature suffers ends gradually after 24 hours. A creature can only attempt this saving throw once, requiring a long rest before attempting it again.", "Mourningberry - Traditionally found near graves and other deathly places, the leaves and flowers of this plant can be seeped into a tea, but its berries are mildly toxic. When brewed, the tea acts as a slight depressant, relaxing those that drink it and making them disinterested in conflict or confrontation. Often served ceremonially at funerals.", "Nararoot - A shaved-down tuber seeped into a tea, its natural licorice flavor is softened into a musky semi-sweet aroma. This tea functions as a form of birth control; a female humanoid that drinks this tea is rendered infertile for a period of 2 weeks. A similar tea for male humanoids is derived from cassil, though that tea costs 10 gp for every 1/20 lb.", "Pale Jade - A light and airy white tea, cultivated in Kara-Tur, primarily within Shou Lung. A popular export, many merchants and tea connoisseurs hold this tea as an excellent introduction to proper tea drinking.", "Par-Salian's Blend - A smoky, citrus-rich blend of herbs that soothes the throat, passed down between the magi of Krynn. If a creature drinks this tea, it suppresses any conditions that cause a hacking cough for 24 hours.", "Sandberry - These yellow berries grow in the Western Heartlands, proliferating in otherwise barren and ravaged areas. Tea brewed from these berries is yellow in color and has a harsh, bitter, and acidic taste, but nevertheless is favored by travelers as an excellent source of hydration in arid lands.", "Talkuth - Made from groundleaf, a hardy plant that is one of the few things which can survive the bitter cold of the North. This tea is slate grey with a metallic tang, and is generally considered unpalatable to those not used to consuming it.", "Tal, blackroot - Brewed by the halflings of Khorvaire’s Talenta Plains, this beverage is served piping hot and carries a taste of bitter cinnamon.

A secret: the sap of a treant, woad warrior, or blight is bitter. But together, simmer them. Put over any dark meat and find a bottle of dark, cheap red wine.", "The blood of a vampire spawn is intoxicating. Mix with a bloody-mary (that tomato based morning juice drink). Add in some raw vegetables. Celery, olives, carrots, and the like. Bottoms up.", "Demon Wing Soup: It’s very spicy, and the wings are chewy, but there isn’t a whole lot for a humanoid to eat in hell, so it works.", "Candied Quipper: One of the cheapest quick snacks around. Quippers taste uncompromisingly bitter and have an awful crunch to them. They still aren’t very good once dipped in boiling tree sap, but at least they are covered in candy…", "Honeyed Siren’s Tongue: The tongue of a siren produces the most wonderful sound when chewed, bards will often accompany instrumental performances with the chewing of a Siren’s tongue in order to woo crowds even further. Mixing it with honey makes it slightly easier to chew, but cooking it causes it to lose these magical effects.", "Water Elemental Juice: The fluid harvested from a living water elemental has been known to retain effervescent properties after being harvested due to residual magic power left over in the collected sample. Water elemental juice can be mixed with anything from potions to fruit juice to make a refreshing bubbly beverage. It is suggested to not drink the substance without dilution.", "Pixie Salad: A tossed salad of finely chopped pixies will always produce the flavors of the colors of the rainbow. Each bite may taste like a different color, the first might be purple, the second may taste like red and so on and so forth. The older the salad is since the death of the pixies the closer the taste is to brown.", "Trollbalaya: A jambalaya made from troll sausage, typically with a drizzle of boiled troll blood, topped with two Troll’s eyes. (Trolls are surprisingly delicious)", "Pulled Orc Sandwiches: Typically made from Orc shoulder or pectoral, the younger the orc the better. Requires 10 hours of cooking over old coals, best seasoned with an elven blend, two chopped onions, and copious salt and pepper.", "Burritoes: Giant’s toes are surprisingly rich in protein and healthy fats. Chop them, Sear them, cook two behir eggs in the left over grease, and create an excellent set of breakfast burritos. For a bit of added fun, they are best served on the toe nail.", "Rib-hirs: Behir’s are nasty buggers, but they’re good for one thing: ribs. The longest rib cage you will find, gather up your town, or the local goliath tribe, and you’ll make a killing off of these. Flay the scales and smoke at a low heat over hickory logs for 2 days, slowly rotating the ribs through. A nice baste of dwarven ale mixed with citrus, or a rub of an orcish spice blend will make this a meal to remember. Just keep in mind the smell will travel for miles, so you might attract a nearby Roc.", "Roc Stock & Balor: While not actually made with Balor flesh, this demonic delicacy is as the name implies a stew made from Roc stock and any sort of demonic flesh. Due to the hellish nature of the flesh, the stew does not need any outside heat to work itself to a hearty temperature. Good for those in survivalist situations, assuming you can ignore the faint brimstone smell.",
