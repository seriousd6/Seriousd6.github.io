This sets off the monstrous headache you had only just started to understand you had. You slide off the wooden… shelves, covered with straw? that you were sleeping on and stagger to your feet. NOW the headache hits: this is a hangover only in the sense that the plague is an illness. You are in your only set of fine clothes, now ruined: smeared with mud, dung, broken eggs, straw and the thick, pungent smell of the jug of mysterious liquor you now remember that guy in the hat insisting you drink. A couple of hens peck the ground near your feet. You vomit in the dust and straw in front of you: the chickens investigate. You wash out your mouth with the last sip of stale water from your canteen. Now you can see that you were sleeping on the bench of a wagon, which somehow crashed through the wall of the chicken coop. Vanished are the horses you remember pulling the wagon, too fast across a bridge with the rest of the party in the back. The rest of your party is sprawled across the coop and begins to awaken. The rooster crows again. Gods, it hurts.",

They find that they have stumbled across something dangerous, secret, or supernatural, and must then deal with it in order to enjoy a little rest.', 'Some bad guys have arrived and done some bad guy things. The PCs were none the wiser. The bad guys have now made good their escape, and the PCs have caught wind of it in time to chase them down before they make it back to their lair, their home nation, behind enemy lines, etc.', "Usually through trickery (but sometimes by digging into the PCs' past), an antagonist has something to hold over the heads of the PCs and make them jump. This could be any kind of threat from physical to social, but it depends on the villain having something - even if it's information - that others don't have. Now, he is pulling the strings of the PCs, telling them to do things they don't want to. The PCs must end the cycle of blackmail, deprive the villain of his edge, and keep him temporarily satisfied while doing it.", `Mission objective: enter the dangerous place, and retrieve the vital dingus or valuable person. Overcome the area's defenses to do so.`, 'The PCs must secure a target for the good guys. There are bad guys there that prefer not to be secured.

They go to explore it, and must deal with its supernatural denizens to win the treasure and get out alive.", 'The PCs are stranded in a strange place and they must survive by finding food and shelter, and then worry about getting back home.', "A crime or atrocity has been committed, the PCs must solve it. They must interview witnesses (and prevent them from being killed), gather clues (and prevent them from being stolen or ruined). They must then assemble proof to deliver to the authorities, or serve as personal ministers of justice.", 'The PCs have a valuable object or person, which needs to be taken to a safe place or to its rightful owner, etc. They must undertake a dangerous journey in which one or more factions (and chance and misfortune) try to deprive them of the thing in their care.', 'The PCs are placed in charge of a large operation (a trading company, a feudal barony, the CIA). Despite a lack of experience in such things, they must make it work and thrive.', "A person (church group, nation, galaxy) is in a hazardous situation they can't survive without rescue.The PCs are on the job. In some scenarios, the hook is as simple as a distant yell or crackly distress signal.", "The PCs, while traveling or exploring, come across a hornet's nest of bad guys, preparing for Big Badness. They must either find some way to get word to the good guys, or sneak in and disable the place themselves, or a combination of both.", "Within a defined area, something important and valuable exists. The PCs (or their employers) want it, but so do one or more other groups. The ones that get it will be the ones that can outthink and outrace the others, deal best with the natives of the area, and learn the most about their target. Each competing group has its own agenda and resources.",

They must solve the mystery of their attacker's motives, and in the meantime fend off more attacks. They must put two and two together to deal with the problem.", "The PCs are a diplomatic vanguard, trying to open up (or shore up) either political or trade relations with a strange culture. All they have to do is manage for a day or so among the strange customs without offending anybody . . . and what information they have is both incomplete and dangerously misleading.", "The PCs are working surveillance - spying on a person, gathering information on a beast in the wild, scouting a new sector. Regardless of the scale, the primary conflict (at least at the start) is the rule that they are only to watch, listen and learn. They are not to make contact or let themselves be known.", "Someone is gone: they've run away, gotten lost, or simply haven't called home in a while. Somebody misses them or needs them returned. The PCs are called in to find them and bring them back.", "One or more of the PCs wakes up with no memory of the recent past, and now they find themselves in some kind of trouble they don't understand. The PCs must find the reason for the memory lapse, and solve any problems they uncover in the meantime.", "Something both bad and inexplicable is happening (racial tension is being fired up in town, all the power is out, the beer supply is drained, it's snowing in July, Voyager still has fans, hordes of aliens are eating all the cheese), and a lot of people are very troubled by it. The PCs must track the phenomenon to its source, and stop it.", "The PCs are assigned to guard a single vital spot (anything from a mountain pass to a solar system) from impending or possible attack.

They must investigate to find out more about the caper, and then act to prevent it.", "Somebody has tinkered with Things Man Ought Not, or opened a portal to the Mean People Dimension, cracked a wall at the state prison, or summoned an ancient Babylonian god into a penthouse. Before the PCs can even think of confronting the source of the trouble, they must deal with the waves of trouble already released by it: monsters, old foes out for vengeance, curious aliens who think cars/citizens/McDonald's hamburgers resemble food, and so forth.", "Somebody needs a dingus (to fulfill a prophecy, heal the monarch, prevent a war, cure a disease, or what have you). The PCs must find a dingus. Often an old dingus, a mysterious dingus, and a powerful dingus. The PCs must learn more about it to track it down, and then deal with taking it from wherever it is.", "A town, castle, starship, outpost, or other civilized construct is lying in ruins. Very recently, it was just dandy. The PCs must enter the ruins, explore them, and find out what happened.", `The PCs must travel through a hazardous area, and get through without being killed, robbed, humiliated, debased, diseased, or educated by whatever is there. The troubles they encounter are rarely personal in nature - the place itself is the "villain" of the adventure.`,

The PCs have to go where the trouble is, locate the bad guys, and stop the party.", "The PCs are explorers, and their goal is to enter an unknown territory and scope it out. Naturally, the job isn't just going to be surveying and drawing sketches of local fauna, something is there, something fascinating and threatening.", `Any of the basic plots in this list can be re-engineered with the PCs on the outside of it. Either the PCs are accompanying other characters in the midst of such a plot (often being called on to defend the plot from the outside, as it were), or they are minding their own business when the others involved in the plot show up, and must pick sides or simply resist. For instance, with Any Old Port In The Storm, the PCs could already be enjoying (or native to) the shelter when a strange group arrives. If the "the PCs are unwelcome" variant is employed, then perhaps the PCs will be the only voice of reason to still the religious fervor, racial prejudice, anti-monster sentiment, or whatever else is the source of conflict.

They are actually just some poor explorer that picked up a cursed artifact. They are basically being used like a puppet by the artifact.`,

They only rob those who can afford it and they try to avoid killing whenever possible.`, `The villain gained power by performing a ritual to capture a greater being and steal its power. Recently, whatever they used for a prison is starting to crack.`, `The villain obeys the law. The villain is very familiar with the laws of the realm and every villainous act they commit is technically within the bounds of the laws of the realm. They may stretch the law, they may bend the law, but they are always just short of breaking the law.

This cycle is predictable once the PCs learn about it. When the villains power wanes they try to keep a low profile.`, `This villain can't stand ignorance from anyone, and take ample time out of the day to explain things to those who demonstrate offensive levels of idiocy. This villain gives seminars to underlings, monologues on the party's failures while beating them up, and can even sometimes be found in deep conversation with some of the greatest minds of the modern age to reduce their own ignorance.`, `Rather curiously, this villain seems to pull their punches. That's because the villain occupies a 'cosmic role', which uncontrollably compels them to carry out certain goals and engage in certain behaviors. The villain knows that after their demise, the universe will force someone else into that role... someone potentially much worse than they.`,

Oddly, if the minion killed the child along with the parents, that's ok. But leaving an orphan brings a great welling of empathy from the villain, which makes him emotionally unstable.`, `The villain collects art. Loves paintings & sculptures and splits its energy between the study and collection of art to its other villainous pursuits. It's easily distracted by the topic and might even spare the life of an accomplished artist.`, `This villain is mentally aging backwards. Physically, it's staying the same, but over the course of 20 years is going from a mature, reasonable adult ego to a more and more childlike emotional age. It's trying to prevent this at all costs, but as its mind reverse ages the unpredictability and lack of longer term planning keep getting worse.`, `This villain is an empty conduit for a demonic portal. It's essentially a diving suit that is used by demons from the abyss. Depending on the demon that is taking it for a drive that day it might have completely different priorities and obsessions or goals. No matter which demon is in the driver's seat though, it is always an agent of chaos and strife, cruel and sadistic to all around, only sparing those that can be of some short term use to the current controller, which might not be useful when the rent-a-planar-body-ride switches hands again.`,

If the heart reaches 0 due to physical damage, it violently collapses, dealing 10d10 radiant damage in a 300ft sphere. If the heart reaches 0 due to necrotic damage, the heart slowly begins to shrivel up, until it is about the size of a grape, at which point it collapses into dust.", "Eldritch Rod: Created by an unknowable primordial deity, it appears to be composed of dark oak into the shape of a long tendril.

Thus, the only way to destroy the Key would be to open the room where you are unable to interact with anything, and then leave the key in that room, and then close the door. This would render the key stuck in a place which no longer exists. Bonus points for going into multiple layers of that room and leaving it deeper.",
        "The Rift Sigil: A sigil of an arcane rune, which, when placed on a surface creates a hole which expands 1d10 feet in all directions each week. The hole is an extradimensional rift which consumes objects and creatures that it encounters: the passage is one way, and creatures and objects that pass through it are destroyed. A creature may willingly enter the hole: a creature that does so survives the trip, as their willpower keeps them from being consumed by the void on the other side. They take 1d10 psychic damage per minute while here. Destroyed by: A runestone exists inside this realm: it is sentient, and has the following statistics.

However, this also works the other way around. Introduction: The protagonist could be either extreme good or extreme evil character killing like-oriented individuals. The PCs then find out about the heart. Destroyed by: The heart loses HP for each willing participant (depending on how much of a good or bad person they were). The heart originally starts with 1HP but increases with every unwilling participant of the ritual by 1 point.", "The Orb of Omniscience: Like a crystal ball with telepathy but anybody can use it any number of times per day.

Destroyed by: For every point of damage it takes, it immediately heals the same amount, and conjures a spectral weapon that seeks out it’s attacker and does the same amount of damage back. The only way to destroy it is to burn it in the fires of the forge where it’s first weapon was created.", "Clockwork Heart: While in the process of creating the Modrons, Primus created a clockwork heart. Since this heart wasn’t useful to making the Modrons he set it aside and forgot about it. In order to attune to this artifact you must hold it pressed to your heart during a short rest. The artifact slowly enters your chest and fuses with your heart. Unattuning kills the person because the artifact can’t be unfused from their heart. While attuned to this artifact you have advantage on death saving throws. Also you can open up a portal that leads to the plane of Mechanus or back to the material plane from Mechanus once per day. Modrons recognize Primus’ creation and will avoid fights with the person attuned the clockwork heart unless they are attacked. Once a creature has attuned to the Clockwork Heart, they begin to gradually lose the ability to feel emotion and instead become more logical. The process is slow, but speeds up significantly whenever an aspect of the heart is used (such as opening a portal to Mechanus or making a death saving throw only because of the advantage provided by the artifact). At the end of the process, the creature will be completely unable to experience any emotion and will become a logic-centered being. Destroyed by: The heart most be brought to a plane of chaos, tainting it. Once the heart is tainted, it can be destroyed as a normal object.",

The user can give it simple instructions that the beast will follow until the day it dies, and keep commanding it. Destroyed by: The Staff is also able to control the minds of creatures emotionally bound to people, like pets and familiars. However, the person who the creature was bound with can attempt to break the spell by making the monster recognize him/her (which would take some time and Wisdom checks).

The mirror itself can also cast various mind control spells on targets visible in the mirror at the user’s behest (DM’s discretion on which and the number of uses per day). The insidiousness is multiplied because the mirror’s control is such that targets may not realize that they were influenced by a spell, especially if they were only instructed to do reasonable things. The mirror can even be used to disadvantage the charisma and wisdom saving throws of targets visible in it if needed. Other Suggestions: The Machiavellian Mirror’s owner should be intelligent and paranoid, someone who takes all sorts of mundane and magical precautions to prevent the mirror from being visible and even having a reflection, especially when not in use. The owner should also take precautions to make sure they are knowledgeable of even potential threats, and that they are visible and findable at all times (e.g. command a ring of spies). Destroyed by: If the Machiavellian Mirror can “see” its own reflection clearly, (e.g. another mirror or smooth surface polished finely is brought into close range in appropriate lighting conditions), the mirror spontaneously smashes itself into smithereens and becomes useless.

        "Sol Stone: a stone of clear quartz like crystal approximately 8inches long and 5feet wide, and weighs 2lb. The stone when inactive gives the bearer advantage on fire/ radiant saves. It is mostly know for this property so it is sought by creatures harmed by these energies. However, it absorbs these energies and once it has absorbed 2d6x10 HP of these energies it becomes active. Once it is active the stone becomes the center of a sphere of fire 5' in diameter. Immediately does 3d6 fire and radiant damage to all creatures in the square it inhabits and then all creatures in base contact with it save vs. Dex, saves half damage. all flammable materials in 10' ignite. every other round the sphere expands 5'. It continues to do this damage until it is 50' in diameter. It casts bright light 60' and dim light an additional 30'. At 50' in diameter it now does 6d6 fire and radiant damage and acts as a siege engine doing double damage to all structures and terrain. If underground it will melt rocks and burst soils as it expands. it will expand 5' every minute until it is 150' in diameter. it casts bright light 120' away from it's surface and dim light 60' beyond that. At 150' in diameter the air temperature within 500' of the sphere is 150F degrees and all creatures must make a save vs Con or take one point of exhaustion along with the 6d6 fire and radiant damage within 500' of the surface of the sphere. Regional Effects: all vegetation within 100' of the sphere will ignite. Lakes, ponds, streams, will be evaporated. It will continue to grow 5' every minute until it reaches 500' in diameter. it is blinding light up to 240' from it's surface (save vs. Dex or blinded condition for 2d4 rounds), bright light 240' beyond that, and dim light for half a mile beyond that. At 500' in diameter the following regional effects happen: any creature within 1 mile of the sphere takes 6D6 fire and radiant damage every round. any flammable substance will ignite within 1000' of the surface of the sphere. A strong wind will emanate from the sphere pushing any existing forest fires 20' a round. This wind will begin to make the sphere levitate vertically until it is exactly 1 radius above the ground (250'). once it reaches this height double the effect radius. all creatures that want to move toward the sphere must make a save vs strength or can only move 5' toward it. flying creatures must make a Save vs. Dex. failures crash to the ground. The sphere will continue to grow 10' in radius every hour until it reaches 1000' in diameter. The sphere casts daylight for 10 miles from it's surface. Once it reaches 1000' it explodes causing 6d6 Fire, radiant, thunder damage to every creature within 100 miles of the epicenter of the sphere. The explosion will automatically knockdown all structures with less than 100 HP, it will ignite all forests, vegetation and flammable objects within that range. all creatures within that 100 mile radius must save vs Dex or be deafened and blinded for 1d6 days. in the center of the crater will be nothing but the Sol Stone. The growth of the sphere can not be stopped with water, ice or cold magic. if the sphere is moved using magic the affects are not stopped the epicenter just moves, spreading the damage/ effects as it goes. The sol stone has a threshold of 10hp a DR to slashing piercing and a total of 30hp. if broken in it's inactive state it will shatter into 2d4 pieces, each has the same properties as the inactive state stone. Only a wish spell can stop its expansion. to recognize an inactive Sol stone is an Arcana check DC 12, to know what it's active state looks like is an Arcana check DC 20. The burning sphere can be teleported, plane shifted and if still small enough pushed through a dimension door. If placed in a portable hole it is frozen at the point in time but not extinguished. even in the elemental plane of water it will go through it's stages of destruction. on the elemental plane of fire it will give birth to 2d6x10 fire elemental creatures when it explodes.

Clothes, people, plants... dice. These things weren’t always quartz, you know. Life/Death: • ⁠instantly remove life from all creatures within a 20 foot radius.

Their bodies are not restored. That fossil 100 feet underground? Alive. The casualties of the Battle of the Red Valley? Living Skeletons. • ⁠instantly removes life from all creatures in a 20-foot radius EXCEPT the roller. • ⁠every nanosecond, life is removed from one cell in the roller’s body. If the roller is not technically alive, the same effect is applied in a 5-foot radius around them. This effect follows the roller and lasts forever. Sentience: • ⁠instantly gives sentience to every living thing within one mile. • ⁠randomly swaps around the minds of every sentient being in a 1d10 mile radius. • ⁠turns the roller into a mental vegetable by ceasing all higher brain function. • ⁠allows the roller to cast Greater Awakening at will. Planar Separation: • ⁠opens a portal to a random elemental plane inside the roller’s lungs • ⁠the current plane is duplicated exactly, and the original is completely deleted. All the PCs now have to deal with the truth that they are not the original PCs. • ⁠merges two random planes into one. Magic: • ⁠roller can cast any 9th-level spell of their choice once per day. • ⁠Magic is erased from the universe as a whole. Spells and spell-like abilities have no effect, and all magical effects are immediately dispelled. • ⁠roll on the 10,000 random effects table 5d10 times. • ⁠every creature in a 1 mile radius gains 20 levels in either Wizard, Sorcerer, Bard, Warlock, Cleric, or Druid. • ⁠all natural 20s count as natural 1s, forever. • ⁠all natural 1s count as natural 20s, forever. • ⁠roll 3 additional times on the magic die effect list. Force: • ⁠the planet’s gravity is halved or doubled • ⁠the nearest star now burns half or double as hot and bright • ⁠Mage Hand’s maximum weight is multiplied by 10.

It will try to convince the user that it really just wants to help them succeed at whatever they're trying to do. It will invisibly perch on the user's shoulder and whisper advice to them, giving them advantage on ALL skill and attack checks ('Duck now!', 'Tell the shopkeeper how handsome he is.', 'Use the long lockpick with the curve in it', etc.). During long rests, the imp will ask for nourishment in the form of the users blood. Accommodating the imp results in a cumulative reduction/day of 1% of the character's max hp, rounded down (i.e. a character with 50 max hp will lose no hp on the first day, max at 49 on the second day, etc.) This hp lost can be regained through normal means, such as Cure spells, but the effect starts over at the next rest. Failing to allow the imp to feed or otherwise alerting any other character to its presence and/or effects results in the imp becoming hostile and fleeing, only to later return and begin plaguing the character with bites, stings, and scratches during their sleep. This means that the benefits of long rests are reduced to those of short rests and short rests are useless. The imp can be 'killed' but as soon as it reconstitutes enough of itself to re-manifest on the material plane (a time frame of the DM's discretion), it will hunt down the original character and begin plaguing them again. Oh, and it tells you things about the other player characters - what they said when you weren't around, what they really think, how much of the treasure they took....", 
        "The Poking Stick: a normal 10 foot pole. It can be used to poke things and see what they do. Applicable to suspicious chests, glowing things, sleeping dragons, etc. Using it successfully will make you want to poke more things with it. For more fun, have it be an intelligent object that is obsessed with more poking and is only attunable to halflings, kender, chaotic neutral alignments, tabaxi, and rogues", "Map of the Gods: This parchment, nondescript but for a copyright print belonging to The Recursion Company, unfolds into a map of the world you occupy, overlaid with a square grid where one square is equal to 100mi2. You can poke a square with a finger. If you do, the entire area of that square in the real world is crushed under a gargantuan finger from space which deals 512d8 damage to everything in that area, with a DEX save under disadvantage to take only half damage. Objects automatically fail this save. You can continue to unfold the parchment a further 7 times. Each time you do, the scale adjusts, centered on you, with the squares becoming 50mi2, 10mi2, 1mi2, 500ft2, 100ft2, 50ft2, and 5ft2. Moving around with the map unfolded continues to center on you. The damage from poking a square halves each time you unfold the parchment (doubling if you fold it back again). So, to extrapolate, poking the map after unfolding it eight times does 4d8 damage to one area of 5 square feet. You can only poke the map once a day. After you do, the map folds itself back into the starting condition. You can attempt to unfold the map a ninth time. However, you have a bad feeling about it which stops you at the last second. If you try again, the feeling is really, really bad. If you try a third time - well, the map tried to warn you. The ninth unfolding unfolds you and your soul into a two-dimensional being. You no longer need to breathe, eat or sleep, and can pass through walls. All of your weapons now do slashing damage. However, your AC is reduced to 10, a single point of damage will instantly obliterate you, and your two-dimensional soul will not be able to be resurrected in a three-dimensional body.",

Up to 10 of the miniatures are equipped with concealed needles for drawing blood, and the room itself can be attuned to one individual. When the attuned individual is at the table, he can set a blood-filled miniature on it to gain an immediate bird’s eye view of the donor’s surroundings, up to 50 miles square. If the donor is underground or indoors, the view switches to a map of the structure, which is unveiled as the donor explores. The donor and the attuned individual can freely communicate. 3x a day, the attuned individual can perceive the viewed area as through the spell True Seeing. 1x a day, the attuned individual can use the table to cast Meteor Swarm, targeting the projectiles anywhere within the viewed area. Switching between miniatures takes about 5 minutes. The blood must be renewed once a year to maintain the connection. The connection between donor and room can be severed by either washing the blood out of the miniature with cold water (no harm to donor) or by dropping the miniature into a boiling pot (triggers immediate death save by donor), neither of which actually requires the attuned individual to be involved. The donor does not need to be willing or aware of the blood sampling for the room to work, nor are they automatically aware of all functions of the room. Destroyed by: Weakness: A blood donor who willingly and knowingly provided a sample may betray and kill the attuned individual.

He sent you to find this person with the order that you'd kill on sight and tie up loose ends for him.", "They are sent by a cloaked figure of an old woman to kill some pesky Shadows out in the woods. Her cabin borders the woods and she gets the worst of it. 'It needs to stop.' she begs them. The shadows are seen huddling together near the base of a tree. When they return the Hag thanks them for their service and is ecstatic at the eerie silence they've helped make. Those Shadows belonged to the villagers who hid them in the woods to protect themselves from the Hag. The entire village is slaughtered...no wounds, no blood, as if they died right in the middle of what they were doing.", "The party encounters a dog in the forest that is barking at a rock. Upon inspection, the rock appeats to have a button. When pressed, a door opens in the rock. The dog goes inside and looks if you follow. The dog assists you in defeating the enemies (but is not too powerful. At the end of the day it's a dog... Right?). When you get through the halls into a big room there are a few guards standing near the walls (I'd say 4 or so, depending on your party) that ready their spears as you enter. Then, they say 'Welcome back master, should we kill these intruders?' If the party looks around/behind them, they will see that the dog is grinning. The dog was the boss; it was all a trap. The dog is a shapeshifter. Depending on your story, you could choose to take the party prison instead, or just outright fight them.",

The Captain is a stout, imposing tiefling with many scars and a deep rasp to his voice, but a surprisingly gregarious nature. He will introduce himself as Captain Koskinen of The Kotka and Commodore of the Hukkunut Fleet. He will take the PCs to the bridge of the Kotka and gesture behind the ship, into the storm, where a vast fleet of lost ships are following, in increasingly poor condition the deeper into the sandstorm they ride. The entire fleet sails the desert as if it were an ocean. Occasionally another ship will pull level with the Kotka, allowing the players to swing across, Errol Flynn style.

In an act of defiance toward gods of nature, Abu-Nazim has decided to create and expand his pond using his magical prowess. Abu-Nazim’s opposition to gods has attracted three other figures to the location, who all oppose gods in one shape or form. Among resident is an old human druid who lost his faith when despite all his efforts, the grove of oaks he tended to died 5 years ago. The druid packed what little possessions he had, along with all the acorns he could find and set about finding a new place to settle. He has yet to try planting his acorns in the desert soil, but he is afraid of losing the few acorns he has to the hot climate of the region. Also among the residents is a fugitive inventor who had to leave town after he burned down a temple with one of his giant mirrors. He claims that the incident was an accident, but a successful Insight check will reveal that he is lying. In reality, he burned the temple to appease an extra-planar entity (a demon). The inventor’s tent is surrounded by scrap metal and roughly polished sheets of metal. The fourth resident is an elf who has settled in the camp site no more than 2 month ago.

When the party walks through it, they feel a tingling sensation and their hair starts to stand on end. If they inspect the ground more closely, they notice that the sand around them is vibrating ever so slightly. Something barely perceptible zooms past the group from behind. It stops and hovers in mid-air before the party’s vanguard. It’s a dull brass orb, weathered, dented and about the size of a human fist. It buzzes once, then pauses. Then buzzes again. After a brief delay, it starts to move again. The party follows it about 100 ft., where it stops abruptly, and drops straight down into a hole that must’ve been specifically made for it. The static intensifies…",

When the party reaches X location in the desert, if they roll a high enough nature/perception, they will notice something is off, though the longer they don’t, the higher the DC goes up. This can result in a battle between the giant desert snake and the party, or a way to guide the party to a certain area using the giant snake as a spirit guide.", "An ancient stone village is peeking out from the sands.

The long, rectangular structure is the symbolic home of the Hexune, a six-aspected deity of arcane magic, and the worship center for the cryptic wildfire elves who have adapted to these hostile environs. Like the inscrutable energy of flame, the elves believe that their god, and the volatile magic that it births, are inherently unknowable. Certainty is shunned, and paradox is embraced.

However, the librarian is bound to the library and so long as they do not leave the temple, they will not age.

A 25ft-diameter fire burns in a massive brazier in the middle held aloft by bronze chains, a large hole in the ceiling above to let out smoke.

The main entrance is located behind the edifice, not to protect the identities of supplicants, but to preserve the dignity of the needy.

More than once this structure has saved rural herders from deadly storms, warning them in time to seek shelter in the nearby grottos. Anthropologists have studied the chapel’s construction, finding artfully placed tubes and channels in the stonework that redirect winds into musical pitches, like a static pipe organ.

Many signs indicate this chapel was built by hill dwarves who were both awed and terrified by the region’s severe winds.", "The Well Within – a psychic sanctum preserved by Githzerai, accessible only to initiates who have been given a linked grounding item.

Located in a large salt flat that seems like nothing more than deserted wasteland for miles.

Most are family-owned restaurants who pass down a set of secret recipes, dishes they claim impressed their god of cuisine when he appeared to them. All are free to come and eat. The families subsist on donations from the locals. Families likely have intense rivalries with each other, especially if they coexist in the same district or town.

It’s built so that the local river runs down the middle, with a cliffside waterfall pouring down into the northern end of the ziggurat; the water fills channels and pools before washing out to the lands below. Clergy perform healing and therapy for the injured and traumatized who find their way to the temple’s steps, and mummify the recently deceased before setting them on a journey down the river.

         "Three Sisters’ Convene – three separate temples situated on adjacent limestone cliffs, each dedicated to a sister goddess; the red one Discipline, the blue one Compassion, and the yellow one Righteousness. Under their vaulted domes, each mountain temple trains their disciples in a specific philosophy, martial art, and style of magic. The three temples’ cliffs are connected by wide stone bridges to a central pillar, housing a pagoda where the disciples duel and debate each other.

Certainly, there have been no disasters, natural or otherwise, in the region ever since the temple was refurbished several decades ago. Yet the temple itself still continues to undergo mysterious incidences of severe damage.", 
         "Circle of the Wandering Order – long ago, a nomadic people discovered writing. This forever changed their religion, which was focused around wandering to accrue new stories and experiences. A schism split the people, with some wanting to settle down and write down their oral traditions, while others wanted to continue with the old ways. The Circle was created to heal this divide. A large, circular white stone gazebo amidst grasslands, the Circle sits atop a subterranean library of holy texts. An ornate metal cage sits between its pillars, containing a dull white orb of light. As the priests sleep on their bedrolls next to it, they commune with other priests traveling abroad, and take in their stories to write down later.", "“The Shortcut” – This ‘temple’ dedicated to a trickster god appears to an outsider as a simple alleyway. In truth, the alley is it’s own pocket of extra dimensional space, with the exit and entrance to the alley corresponding to completely different places.

Under the watchful eyes and fiery inspiration of their god, guided by dutiful priests, ordinary craftsmen perform wonders. The temple-forge is always running, supplied with materials mundane and exotic from pilgrimages, divinely chartered trading routes, and tithes from campaigns of conquest. All things created here – from armor and clothing to glasswork and furniture – are of excellent craftsmanship and are blessed with unusual properties by the god of labor. Of course, care must be taken not to abuse the works of the Asballicuo, for its god’s blessings might become curses when misused.", "The Old Mounds – ten artificial oblong hills spread over nine square miles are all that remain of an ancient culture. Each is roughly the same size, and each have a set of stairs that run up one side and down the other. A fortified cathedral and its surrounding village lie at its outskirts. The priests document all the specific paths one can take when walking the ten hills, at different times of day, in different orders, in search of the ‘shadow mounds’. These are artificial hills that lie in both the Prime Material Plane and another plane of existence, but can only be found by walking a specific path in the old mounds. So far, the only empirically documented shadow mound leads to the Shadowfell.",

A straight brick path of orange feldspar connects all three and leads out to where it connects to the local town’s roads. The first chamber is for purification, where guests shed their shoes, have their feet washed, and are otherwise cleaned; this is a public service that both trainee clergymen and volunteers perform. In the second chamber, guests may pray quietly for guidance and direction on prayer rugs, or they may offer alms at the central altar (which the feldspar path weaves around) in order to bestow good fortune upon a journey. The third chamber is strictly for clergymen to pray and fast- it is closed off to the public.", "Journey’s End Monastery – A sacred temple built by retired adventurers in the husk of an ancient castle.

Due to the frigid temperatures of the region, it never melts and hasn’t for hundreds of years. It was said to have been build by frost giants before they all traveled farther north.

Kiirn is less concerned with the cargo than the people at this point. The third stage follows the retreat up the beach, a chase through the rainforest on the island. The players may chase Kiirn to finish him off as he leads them to his cove, or Kiirn may chase the players, angered by their defiance and the damage they’ve done, or perhaps angered that they escaped him at the beach. The fourth stage is a fight in a large cave that leads to the cove. This is the point at which players and Kiirn alike are likely be exhausted and close to death. FINISH HIM.

The obelisk is covered in glowing arcane sigils and scribbles that shine brighter when the player’s step forward to confront it, at which point the assorted defenders move to attack. The obelisk manifests a eye-like sigil which moves around its surface each turn to channel a beam that repairs and reanimates fallen defenders. This beam causes the target to regain 3d8 hit points as the components are magically regrown and imbued once more with magical energy, and is fired one time on each of the obelisk’s turns. Any destroyed constructs hit with the beam come back to life at 0 hit points and regain the amount rolled for the beam, though they cannot take their turn until the following round. To beat the obelisk boss, the invaders may attempt to attack a construct targeted by the eye beam while the ray is being channeled, which causes the amount of damage dealt to it to also go through to the arcane entity within the obelisk. The boss also takes 10 damage every time one of the arcane sigils or a significant part of a particular scribble is erased or damaged in some way, whether the marks are gashed deeply with a blade or blotted out with a destructive spell. The arcane entity within the obelisk has a total of 80 hit points, while the obelisk and the magical markings on it have an AC of 15.

The Flesh Golem’s skin has seen a number of brutal battles, and has caused it to become torn which a poor slave has had to stitch up repeatedly after each battle. The Golem often bleeds from the stitches in combat ex-specially when the beast takes fire damage causing the creature to take disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. The creature often leaves out a loud roar when burned by any source of fire damage.

The gargoyle’s skin is tough rock, making it immune to all but psychic damage, unless the damage is applied to the tissue under the scratch.

Maybe the kids there never grow up and some children on the Material Plane dream of getting to go there.Or maybe the kids still grow up and kick people out into random realms once they go over 18.`, `Ultra Fractal: a plane in which size does not matter.

        `Tempore Mortis - A plane where time has no meaning and acts in unpredictable ways. Vast expanses of bleach white sand cover the plane with occasional spouts of sand falling into the pitch black abyss of a sky. Despite this, it is constantly bright out, though the air is stale with a slight grey hue of dust that never settles. Black bones of creatures fossilized in place dot the landscape and travellers must be wary of running into patches of time that move rapidly forward, or backward, or not at all.`, `Conifer - An endless forest that has no top and no bottom. The many animals and various native populations live among the branches of the massive trees. Plants, trees, poisons, and herbs of all kind, mundane or mystic can be found here. But travelers should stick to the well established branch pathways, lest they be swallowed by the forest and never return .The plates of giant pinecones are a popular building and craft material.`, `The Quasielemental Plane of Oil: An infinite bog filled with oil, fires, and corpses waiting to become one or the other. With the proper planer magic and technical know how oil wells could be built in the material that spew liquid gold out from the Plane of Oil with no actual drilling necessary. The immense pressure of the plane makes living there a hassle for most, but short trips are possible and companies are willing to pay good money for adventures to travel over and make repairs to their wells.`, 
        `The Great Bath: This ocean sized, warm, sweet smelling, and slightly soapy body of water floats in a peaceful sky. There’ s a few islands in the water and a mile boarder of wooden planks and grass around the perimeter, but 99 % percent of the plane is 3 and a half feet deep water. It is not uncommon for bitter enemies to be visiting the Bath simultaneously, but fights never break out in this sacred place of cleansing. It’ s an odd sight for Angels, Demons, and Devils to be relaxing together, unless you’ re visiting the Great Bath, and then its par for the course.`, `Warp Space– Partially composed of various dimensions and partially made of the space between the planes, Warp Space contains ways into every single plane that exists. However, the whole plane is fractured and unstable, with no permanent pathways. As a result of this, any travel there is extremely dangerous, and the portals rapidly change size, shape, and location, and randomly fade and reappear.`, `The Eighth Great Sea– A vast ocean, not unlike parts of the Elemental Plane of Water. There’ s an ocean floor, islands, and plenty of life. However, be warned. Magic flows freely here, and random spell - like effects can manifest with very little warning. Giant sea monsters and ocean titans walk the sea floor.Fish carry lightning and ice magic with them.`, `The Shattered World– Once a world like the Prime Material Plane, some unknown force broke the world into thousands upon thousands of chunks, some mo larger than a pebble, some the size of a mountain. Those who fall can fall for miles before hitting anything solid.On the plus side, ores are very easy to find, albeit very dangerous to actually mine.`, `The Endless Library– What it says on the tin. An endless library filled with winding shelves and a copy of every book ever written, organized neatly. There obviously isn’ t enough books for an endless library, but after a while the library shelves start to repeat. Helpful modrons organize the books and guide travellers.`,
        `The Plane of Half - Shadows: like the Ethereal plane, this plane is co - located with the Material Plane. So although someone in this plane of existence cannot physically touch things and beings in the Material Plane, they can(dimly) see into it and observe what happens. This ability to see into it is limited, and functions best where there are dark shadows. The darker the shadows, the better one can observe, while the places corresponding to well - lit areas or places of absolute blackness just show up as opaquely thick fog banks in the Plane of Half - Shadows. Spies and thieves speak with wonder of the incredible power this plane offers for surveillance since it allows peeking out from the shadows while being unobserved, not to mention the ability to pass through walls and other solid objects. What these would - be spectators neglect to mention is the significant danger to the unskilled in meddling with travel to this plane. While there are numerous tomes that teach the meditative states or magical processes for entering the Plane of Half - Shadows, most of these sources do not address the question of how to return .Many a skilled rogue has thought themselves masters after discovering how to enter the Half - Shadow state, but then found themselves marooned in an unforgiving landscape of shadow and fog, where nothing is solid(even the residents of this plane are intangible) and they are incapable of affecting the world, except that their loudest screams make their friends and loved ones back on the Material Plane feel slightly uneasy around regions of deep shadows. Eventually this disturbance ceases when the plane traveler dies of starvation leaving their bones behind in the half - shadows.`, 
        `A single immense castle with what seems to be partially maintained grounds is surrounded by dark woods. In the far distance is an immense spiral of a mountain, it’ s peak concealed by few. The whole plane is in shades of black and gray and no color is expressed. Inside the castle is an entry room from which sprawl labyrinthine hallways with infinite rooms that vary from lived in but filthy to rooms which seem as if they have not been occupied for centuries. A staircase also rises from the entry room, allowing for one to go up to more hallways or down in a catacombs below. Visitors must be wary. Pale visages of people may occasionally become visible only to fade quickly once noticed. Undead haunt many of the unused rooms, and the forest is a haunt for gargoyles and the aggressive, twisted, jet - black, parodies of normal fauna are equally as threatening. The denzions of the castle are never seen though evidence of habitation is apparent. Time does not pass in a logical way here, instead it is only relevant to perception, and may pass much faster or slower for those outside of each other’ s perception, and even differently in different rooms. The plane loops around itself so that venturing into the featureless forest eventually leads to the castle or mountain, and the atmosphere is so bleak that characters must succeed on a will save to complete a long rest or fail and have a great depression come over them.`, `The Asylum City: A 4 dimension metropolis, suspended over a chasm within Pandemonium, it is refuge for beings across all different planes. Law and centralized controll is impossible midst the ever changing geography, order only being maintained by crime lords and urban warlords carving themselves a piece of the great city plane `, `The Poisoned Eden: A large collection of swamps and marshland, it is filled with noxious fumes and dangerous animals and spirits, similar to those found in the material plane but far more twisted and primordial. Small pockets of civilization are the slave manors of the residents of this plane, maintaining control through iron fisted brutality. Some wage war on the swamplands while others are content to be kings of their own small pockets of civility `, 
        `The Gentlemen’ s Room: A small plane, consisting only of an ornate, medium sized study room, with a large bookshelf, able to contain countless books due to enchantment, though none of any truely ancient knowledge, as well as a cabinet of fine liquors, and several leather lounge chairs. Its only occupant besides visitors is a butler by the name of Danes, who will work the make the guest comfortable for their stay. Many suspect the plane was invented by a group of nobles who formed a club to have an excuse to get away from their wives.`, `All Sea: An endless plane of salt water, with neither wind nor fish, it is filled with ships from countless ages past, all the ships once lost at sea. Most die of starvation in the realm, though some have managed to create a self sustaining settle from boat wreckage and whatever was left on board the ships.`, `The Land of Gravity and Growth(LOGAG): This land is made up of asteroids that are connected by huge vines the vines get nutrition from the ultra fertile soil that makes up the asteroids. This leads them to be attracted to if he asteroids. This also leads to the asteroids being covered in massive overgrown forests. The plants grow so fast you can see them move if you pay enough attention. Some asteroids being larger and smaller creates some strange gravitational effects, some asteroids have more or less gravity then others and when they pass by each other some strange things can happen.`, 
        `The Land of Glass and Dreams(LOGAD): this plane is much like our own however the trees, the ground, the sea, 1 appears to be made of glass. They have the same feel of there material plane counterparts however they play tricks on the eye. The creatures of this land have learned to use this and the overflowing magic of the realm to there advantage, using illusions, quick movements and various other tricks to catch there prey off guard. Some creatures have even evolved to no longer have eyes so they are no longer deceived by them. The weather seems to have some of the same tricks as the creatures. Light storms, hallucinatory dust coming down from the mountains. You can not trust what you see.`, `The Web Of Lies: The Spider Goddess sits at the center of her web, twitching her lines and pulling the souls in her grasp ever closer to her maw. Her Spiral Skein is a twisted tower of lies and deceit, with eight strands of silk reaching from the roof of the Spider Goddess’ s Tower Palace to the edge of her realm and a sin in each void. The first is lies, a cavern full of pillars pretending to hold up the sky. The second is made up of cramped chambers representing envy, while the third is maggot - filled grottoes filled with seductive light. The fourth contains eternally dark tunnels of fear; the fifth, a place of betrayal; the sixth, an arena of murder. The seventh space is home to arcades of avarice and appetite, containing all things mortals would kill or die for, while the eighth is a flaming skein of fury, representing the death that comes to all mortals.`, 
        `The Crucible: The Crucible is a hierarchy of power, trickery, and conflict. The highest point is Snake Mount, a city built into a mountain that triples in steepness with every twenty paces. There are twelve Arenas here, where mortals and fiends are locked in eternal combat for prestige in the eyes of their lords. Two rivers flow from the Snake Mount, wide and strong their flows, but they are made of the blood of the fighters who perish in the arena. One river carries victors in their longboats to the City of Triumph, a settlement much lower than Snake Mount, but quieter. It has a steady foundation in bedrock, and is shaped in the form of two fighters, one with an axe raised over his head, poised for striking, but the other with a quick dagger flashing from his belt toward his enemy’ s gut. The second river from the Mount is more sluggish, but much broader. It carries the defeated to Mors Adthel, a city which hangs on a cliff over nothingness, where spindly river - rover - men pluck them from the water and pile them up to build a dam to stop the river from taking their city over the waterfall and into the abyss.`,
        `The Filth: The Filth is a vast field of mud under a cold, white sky. There is no landmark, but a single tall, wooden post, upon which sits a ragged figure with the skull of a vulture for a head. If one dares listen, it whispers the way to the Queen of Decay’ s throneroom, deep under the mud, where no light reaches. Innumerable sharp arms pass one down through the suffocating earth, and they take an entrance tax. No mortal finds audience with the Queen of Decay without losing something, perhaps an eye, skewered by a chitinous leg, perhaps the juicy flesh from beneath their fingernails, drilled out by quick mandibles. The Queen herself is unassuming after this ordeal, a diminutive crone, but her world breathes with her, as her hands and legs and intestine, and her garb is made from the remains of past visitors.`, `The Pits: The Taskmaster’s Pits are cold and uninviting, but with occasional great belches of sulfurous heat. The Pits are infinite rolling hillocks of dirt pounded solid by workers’ feet, broken there and here by grey - leafed pine trees. All the mortals here wear masks, and all the fiends are in human form, and go without. They are a busy and determined lot, trooping to and fro listening intently to the commands that come from the crevices that open up in a geyser of bronze fog and a booming, nasal voice. With haste, the masked mortals set about sealing the fissure first with tools, then with the bodies of their fellows, until the wound is healed. The humans wear masks of wood, monstrous faces upon them. The elves wear cloth, and they have babies’ faces. The others wear metal, and they are smooth and featureless. They traipse back into their towns at the end of each working day, afflicted with contentment, and then devour one of their number. The Taskmaster sits at the center of all of this, in the deepest Pit, in a pool of ink and oil, which fills steadily before igniting at a regular interval. When it does, the Taskmaster orders an audience with every mortal soul in his possession, but what they speak of is unknown.`, 
        `The Fair: The demon lord Jubilee’ s realm is a simple affair– a sprawling, lively town engaged in eternal celebration. The occasional drunk has been known to find himself in an unfamiliar town square, between a tall inn, a brothel, a brewery and a fountain that runs with mead. This is Rockton, Jubilee’ s debauched capital, where hedonism and lust run rampant and the sky blushes gold from jubilation. There are stone baths rimmed with amethysts and more than five hundred rooftop statues. Jubilee himself can be found at every place– he is in the inn, dancing on the tables, while Jubilee is drinking in the square, while Jubilee watches drowsily from a grassy patch by a tree. It is no surprise that mortals end up coming here, but they do grow bored as their lord and his fiends do not. They eventually flee into the groves and dells of the surrounding forest, where fouler creatures than drunks dwell, kept infinitely alive on a diet of ale and sex, and driven mad by lust or gluttony or stagnation. There is no fulfillment to be found with Jubilee.`, `The Nightmare: Perhaps of all the major Planes of Existence, the Nightmare defies exploration the most. It is the most visited plane by mortals( for we visit there every time we suffer a nightmare) but also the most changing. Phobetor changes her plane to a fresh horror every few moments, with a tremendous flash of lightning. A mortal might find himself falling from the top of the tallest tower one moment, the next, trapped in a corner as a mountain lion approaches. Another flash, and he is face to face with Phobetor herself, who is an unassailable mass of bone and horn, suspended from above by sinew like a macabre marionette.Her eye sockets are hollow but alive with malice, and her jaw swings open to consume her victim a split second before he awakes, sweating, frightened, but alive and in the Material Plane again.`, 
        `Nerium: Nerium is the Flower that Bites, the Beautiful Snake, a glittering world of alluring smell and hubric brimstone. Curtains of incense cloud the doorways, and vistas of success open up before sudden plunges. A demon lord floats in a caravan pulled by a Halfling who was once an Orc, bound in silk and encircled by a gold band of seven leagues. Banners and standards float from the lord’ s body, trailing throughout the crimson night. There are three windows; through each of them a moon can be seen, and before them all is a dog, who was once an imp, who sits on a tasseled pillow. The pillars and arches of ornate stone give way below to a vast drop, and then a tangled briar of not - quite - trees and almost - flowers. There are beings down there, though it is not clear who or what they are, or once were.`, `The Conjunction– A world of infinite gateways. The gateways lead to all the other dimensions. Many of the gateways also lead to other places in the conjunction.`, 
        `The Web– an entire dimension overrun by giant spiders. Everything is coated in web.`, `Hades Simulacrum: A strange, endless land of white mist and moss covered marble columns. The realm appears to be a by - way between the material plane and the many planes for the dead. Those who fall inbetween end up here. Those who end up here appear as they did in their final moments, never rotting, but if wounded healing to appear as they did on arrival. Living statues, carved to resemble angels and demons, wander the realm mindlessly, lashing out at random passersby.`, `Bank of the Immortals: Any immortal being accumulates many assets, none of which they want harmed. Some create their own planes to hold them. Others visit the bank of immortals, and infintly large, infinitly complex vault / bank plane which will safekeep anything from lich’ s phalacteries, to dragon hoards, to godly artifacts. For a regular fee, be it in gold or in memories `, 
        `Demiplane of Concessions: Often mistaken for a place of refuge and salvation, this sliver of demi - reality is an unending dessert of salted popcorn, ranging in sizes of pebbles to giant boulders. Spiking the landscape are volcanoes that periodically erupt spewing the aforementioned popcorn. Glacially slow rivers of caramel sinuously carve the landscape and travellers might encounter pools of sickly sweet brightly colored shaved ice and sticky gooey cheese. GMs might want to populate the plane with candy - themed monsters.`, `The Reflection: A plane of existence most used for banishing intelligent sentient beings. This realm is composed of countless mirrors in different shapes and forms that reflects the viewers nightmares of their twisted selves. You don’ t have to eat or breathe in the Reflection and whenever die here somehow, you came back to life through a random mirror. However the body of yours now become the reflection of you in that particular mirror.`, 
        `The Bank: Why do coins have so little weight ? Why can gold split into silver ? Why is the currency of the world all the same ? The answer is The Bank. An entire plane made of the magical currency used by all. Plains of platinum, Geysers of gold, rivers of silver, oceans of copper, and forests of electrum. Everything in this plane is money and as such everything that lives in this plane is powerful. Dragons wage war for the hordes, undead pirates roam the seas, and massive titans of coin wander the land. Ruled by The Banker who is magically connected to all coin he manages the wealth of planes. Beware any who take any coin from the plane without The Banker’ s blessing as his Auditors will hunt thieves and counterfeiters across time and space. (a plane to explain those who do not use currency encumbrance and split their money as they need it) `, `Gods’ Grave: There are few places in which the gods avert their gaze but one such place is the Gods’ Grave. Here lies the dead bodies of the gods, even the ones who aren’ t dead yet. These bodies flow with magic and act like islands upon the void and many a mortal who would hide from a god’s anger takes sanctuary here. But be careful where you tread for a god’ s wrath can be awoken from beyond the grave. Evil footsteps upon a good god may erupt radiant fire, a kind heart sitting on a god of war can bubble a horde, and metal feet on a god of nature can unleash nature’ s wrath. And above all, do not step upon, listen, or speak to the bodies of the Gods of Death.`,

The denizens of this plane are all those who have been forgotten, or have vanished under mysterious circumstances from the other planes.`, `The Elemental Plane of Taste: Flavor and texture become more than sensory concepts in this place, here they become real.

The greatest lord currently in the land is a great sugar elemental, who has taken over by crippling all contenders with horrible addictions, which only he can satisfy.`, `The Antipoles: A plane of constant two sided extremes. A continent of constant volcanic eruptions and spewing lava ravaged by an unending hail storm. An plain of earthquakes whipped by undying tornadoes. The stillest, coldest, saltiest, and darkest of oceans exposed to an cloudless stagnant sky burning with three suns. No matter the place lightning will either burst out bellow or strike from above. Some say this plane was created long ago as a hell and prison for the most powerful of the elemental genies. Find one and they may grant an wish with no tricks if you find a way to release them.`, `The Ballroom of Suffering: A room of white crystal that floats like a bubble in an infinite chasm.

The more dangerous the beast the stronger the leather one can receive from it. Skins must be used to create an object before leaving with the leather, if not the leather will come to life outside the realm and attack the party and when these are defeated they turn to dust.

The reason for their mad desire to conquer this dead world is only known to them.`,
        `Masonry: This realm is seemingly an endless series of stone rooms with each room made of different material, designs, and cultural influences. Rooms vary from large ballrooms to cozy offices and in each room are the material for a mason to learn how to make the bricks, mortar, or other aspects of the room. Mastering the technique gives the mason magical insight into the history of the structure and the culture that created it. The rooms may also contain trap doors, secret walls, and traps within the floor and walls as well as occasionally stone constructs that will attack those who enter the room. Each room has four doors and when one enters the room the door behind them closes and disappears. One of the doors in each room will exit the realm to a random realm. If a mason masters 5 methods they can get a magic item that can only be used by masons.`, `The Compass: This realm is a large compass. The sky is a see - through glass surface with a starry sky beyond the glass. This realm is a sea with a large swinging magnetic arm, one half red and one half blue, that shifts and points at some unknown target in the multiverse. Lost sailors often show up in this realm for some strange reason and if they can survive the waters, the flying constructs, and mechanical kraken that inhabit this realm and reach the center they can appear at something they lost, whether it be home or some lost object as long as it belongs to the group or person. A navigator who sails these seas will gain greater insight on directions and locations and as such will have advantage on navigation skill and will always know what direction they are pointing even in other realms and underground.`, 
        `Whittle: This realm is made up of a forest of massive tree houses each tree being a different type of tree or bush. The treehouses are like magical apartment buildings with a small cities worth of people living in each tree. The trees grow equally large fruits and trees that do not have fruits have farms growing crops for the people upon the branches. A wood carver can summon a piece of high quality wood from within each tree to use on a project. Depending on the type of wood, the quality of the carving, and the type of object carved will determine the magical properties of the item carved. Magical properties can be applied to one carved wooden weapon, once carved wooden arrow, and one carved wooden figure. Treants travel across the forest tending to the trees and protecting those who would do it harm. Hostile giant insects live in this realm and the people are willing to pay to have those willing to fight off insects damaging the trees in places out of reach of the Treants.`, 
        `Paint and Pencil: This realm started as a flat piece of paper floating in the void. It seems though as one paints and draws upon this land it grows to match what was drawn and now it is a massive mishmash of different art styles and tones. The realm does seem to have a preference and only those proficient in the drawn arts can contribute as bad art simply erases itself. Caves of charcoal drawn shadow creates and underground towns. Ivory towers drawn in chalk. Painted landscapes and portals to other realms. Pencil sketched citizens and colorful creatures. The surreal nature of this realm means one can come across exaggerated monsters next to realistic animals, a photo - realistic forest next to sideways cherry waterfalls. The creatures of this realm behave as the artist intends but as time passes and the artist dies their nature shifts based on how people respond to the art. A large bear can be a terrifying enemy or a lovable friend depending on how a person interprets the art. Same so to racial biases, a dignified elf may behave like a pompous self - righteous pansy or like a wise and caring mentor, a battle scared orc can be an honorable defender or mindless attacker. If multiple people encounter the same art at the same time have the characters make a wisdom check and whoever wins will have their interpretation of the art be the current reality. If an artist contributes to this realm with both art and adventure the realm will grow a magical paintbrush or pencil that acts as a Magical focus and possess art based spells determined by the DM `,
        `The Tavern– The result of a Wish spell gone awry. This plane consists of a tavern roaring with sounds of merriment and laughter.  Drinks are flowing aplenty and warm, freshly cooked meats and stews are coming out of the kitchen seemingly without end. Someone wished this moment could last forever. Everyone in the tavern knows your name and welcomes you. If you ask them existential questions, they seem to have a hard time hearing over all the laughter and excitement and they just pat you on the back and offer you a stein of ale. You’re welcome to rest in the rooms upstairs. The catch: Opening the front or back doors allows you to see the city streets outside, just as they were in the moment the spell was cast. You can hear the bustling of crowds and hear the rainstorm coming in , but upon passing through the threshold, you find yourself back inside the tavern just as if you were stepping inside. There is some lingering magic in some of the things in the tavern. For example, a fork that when poked through something can lift it as if it was weightless. See the minor magic items list. You may have a knife that cuts through air to create a portal home or a key that causes every door to open to any place on the material plane you wish. Any items removed from The Tavern become inert and after 24 hours, disappear entirely. For added creepiness: There is a large painting on the far wall depicting a merry tavern scene with musicians and laughter. Drinks are being raised to the adventurers just walking in who are cheering in return .Upon closer inspection, the faces of the people walking in seem to resemble your own.`, 
        `The Lost Realm: a world covered in gigantic junk piles. The only way to reach the Lost Realm is to become lost yourself. Everything that has been lost, discarded, or forgotten in any dimension can be found in the Lost Realm(existing simultaneously within their own realm and the Lost Realm). Objects that are lost, discarded, or forgotten slowly materialize into existence withing the Realm. Beings, Creatures, and Objects that are found within their own dimensions slowly fade out of existence from the Realm. Whispers of forgotten knowledge can be heard on the winds. People within the Lost Realm slowly start to lose their memories of who they are and where they are.`, `The Coaxial Concave: This bizarre plane is organized into16 concentric rings that appear to the stacked in descending order of size in constant motion continually shrinking and descending towards its center. When the disc enters the inner most ring, it drops and expands to envelope the 15 other rings taking its place at the top. This cycle takes months or decades depending on some unknown mechanism. Orbiting the concentric rings is a golden glowing orb, giving the discs its cycles of day and night, along with a sizable metallic orb that tends to oppose it. In reality the glowing orb is a Solar Dragon, and the one that serves this plane’ s moon, a Platinum Dragon. Each of the discs are populated by a variety of intelligent species, primarily elemental and constructs, in cities that resemble laboratories, factories and observatories. Strangely, creatures that inhabit any disc are resized when the enter an adjacent disc so that they remain relative in size, respectively. The elementals are unique in physiology, suggesting arcane interventions so old that none recall it, but unlike elements find surprising homeostasis in their bodies— what might be mistaken for mud elementals have geysers of flames or an inferno for its head, a water elemental has lightning sizzling inside it. Some are more extreme in their cohesion, apparently coalescing around powerful crystals. Among the more recognizably humanoid are wryrwoods, androids and intelligent golems each carrying out tasks based on factions who do not share aims but are rarely in conflict. Many of the non - elementals are engaged in astrology, numerology and aeronautics required for the mining of the nearby asteroid bodies, rich in sources of gases, liquids and biomaterial that the rings generally lack.`,
