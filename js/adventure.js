Anyone reflected in the mirror takes half of the damage inflicted on the boss. If the mirror is shattered, the boss gains vulnerability to all damage.", "The boss is a corrupted holy artifact with lots of HP. The artifact’s environmental effect causes the party to regenerate HP and it also fires healing beams. Healing beyond a creature’s natural HP cap is added as temporary hitpoints. If any creature gains more than twice their HP in temporary hitpoints they die. Important detail:the boss cannot benefit from the regenerative environmental effect.", "Initially weak boss with lots of minions, but as the minions die, buff up the boss bit by bit. Either the players press through enemies to quickly kill them or they cut through an army and fight a big old baddy.", "A powerful knight is bound to the Bad Guy’s service. He has to obey anyone who says “please” to him first. The Bad Guy has deafened him so he can’ t hear, but if you cure that…", "A nearly impenetrable (if you dont take him out to dinner first) demon in a human shell, covered in runic tattoos - but if you land an arrow in the circle tattoo on his neck it allows damage to hit the target for the next 10 rounds or maybe however long the arrow is on target. Possible difficulty up - he’ s able to remove the arrows by passing a strength save.", "The Oracle had managed to somehow imprison their (God/Angel), piercing their immortal skin and chaining it up, leaving the weeping deity of rebirth constantly dripping blood. This Oracle uses magic to manipulate this holy blood to instantly heal any injury that they might sustain. The secret to defeating her, however, is to heal the Deity’s injuries, robbing The Oracle of their crude immortality.", "A Bugbear with armor covered in worthless jewels he has glued and embedded in his armor, knocking them out can be used as a bargaining chip to pacify him from attacking.", "A towering, ominous obelisk made of steel is guarded by 3-6 Animated Armors, 3-6 Flying Swords, and 1-3 Helmed Horrors. The obelisk is covered in glowing arcane sigils and scribbles that shine brighter when the player’s step forward to confront it, at which point the assorted defenders move to attack. The obelisk manifests a eye-like sigil which moves around its surface each turn to channel a beam that repairs and reanimates fallen defenders. This beam causes the target to regain 3d8 hit points as the components are magically regrown and imbued once more with magical energy, and is fired one time on each of the obelisk’s turns. Any destroyed constructs hit with the beam come back to life at 0 hit points and regain the amount rolled for the beam, though they cannot take their turn until the following round. To beat the obelisk boss, the invaders may attempt to attack a construct targeted by the eye beam while the ray is being channeled, which causes the amount of damage dealt to it to also go through to the arcane entity within the obelisk. The boss also takes 10 damage every time one of the arcane sigils or a significant part of a particular scribble is erased or damaged in some way, whether the marks are gashed deeply with a blade or blotted out with a destructive spell. The arcane entity within the obelisk has a total of 80 hit points, while the obelisk and the magical markings on it have an AC of 15. Destroying the obelisk entity makes it dissipate into the surrounding area without a trace, causing the arcane markings to go dark and all the constructs to fall apart, thereby ending the boss fight.", "Some amorphous creature that is under the permanent effect of a mirror image spell that refreshes after all images are dispersed (which could be flavored as overlapping images of the same figure, or many different figures, like nightmares, occupying the same space). The trick is to use area of effect spells, or somehow marking the real creature on a successful hit. For instance, striking the creature with a dagger tied to an immovable rod will pin down the real creature and prevent it from shifting around, rendering the mirror mages useless.", "A troll from Chult that was infused with firenewt blood that gives it resistance to fire damage. Acid does normal damage but no longer disables it’s regeneration, only necrotic damage will stop it’s regen.", "Two humanoids (Gladiators, Assassins or Githyanki, for example, depending on the CR you want) whose secret dream is to be an animal. If you polymorph one of them they stop being hostile, and the one you didn’t polymorph will kindly ask you if you can do the same to them. Then they’ll both leave peacefully.", "A massive Clockwork Golem that needs to wind itself up every so often using the wind-up key on it’s back. If it cannot, it powers down and goes dormant until wound back up again.", "A magic user fights with his pet wyvern. The man is difficult to hit due to a variety of defensive and knockback spells such as Wind Wall and Gust of Wind, while the wyvern has naturally tough defenses and resistances. However, when one moves(including reactions), the other doesn’t. They also share the same HP pool.", "A tall thin monk wanders a forest moving with the sounds of nature and attacks with capoeira. He gets + 7 to dexterity unless music with no rhythm is being played. Then he gets -7 to dexterity.", "A tall suit of enchanted armor that roams the countryside, gathering corpses for its necromancer master. It has an obscene amount of health and CON and cannot take damage from an attack that does less than 10 damage. A called attack to the head that does more than 30 damage or a grapple check followed by a DC 15 STR check will remove the armor’s helm from its shoulders, causing it to collapse. An arcana check will reveal that the armor is powered by a small gem on the inside of its forehead. A DC 19 slight of hand can remove the gem.", "An artificer that uses a set pool of arcane energy (let’s say 100 mana) to power his magical armor and wand. He uses various spells, each of which take away mana. His magical armor prevents damage to himself at the cost of mana. However, he can spend a turn draining mana from other lifeforms (namely players), so the trick with him is to either break his gear directly, disable the magical effect somehow or run him out of mana.", "A crystal golem vulnerable to thunder damage fights in a cathedral or other temple. Nearby is a large bell or gong. Attacking the gong converts incoming bludgeoning damage to Thunder area damage. Lure the golem into the area, strike the gong– bingo.", "The Regenerating Water Elemental – A water elemental that heals to full health after each round of combat from the lake in which it resides. Deals AOE damage equal to amount of health regenerated (no other forms of damage output). Must be burst to 0 HP in one turn or somehow disconnected from the lake. (Maybe it’s taunted or charmed into leaving the lake. Maybe the water is frozen or evaporated. Maybe a bubble of air/wind surrounds the elemental.)", "A singular Flesh Golem that’s body size towers over any medium size creature. The Flesh Golem’s skin has seen a number of brutal battles, and has caused it to become torn which a poor slave has had to stitch up repeatedly after each battle. The Golem often bleeds from the stitches in combat ex-specially when the beast takes fire damage causing the creature to take disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. The creature often leaves out a loud roar when burned by any source of fire damage. Whenever the Golem’s hit points fall below 50 % (207/ 18D12+90), any fire damage that the Golem is dealt is also half and dealt to the Golem’s creator who is within 90 feet of the battle.", "A drow beastmaster uses an owlbear to destroy the group. The only problem is that the creature is easily persuaded by food.", "A goblin boss owns an army of 2D12 clay golems.

When disarmed he won’t know where he is or what is going on and surrender immediately. Just make sure that no one else picks up the sword.", "A cyclops that teleports 15 ft back every time it’s hit by an attack. The only way to damage it is by using spells/bombs that affect both spaces at once, stealth attack it, or coordinate multiple attacks, so there are players waiting to strike as the cyclops teleports. Approximate CR is 7, one more than a normal cyclops, even though it’ s stats are the same.", "A gargoyle with a big scratch on it’s neck. The gargoyle’s skin is tough rock, making it immune to all but psychic damage, unless the damage is applied to the tissue under the scratch. A character can make a CR 13 STR(athletics) check to keep it open the bruise for one turn, which becomes a CR 18 check if the gargoyle is airborne. Another character can step in to help, giving the strongest character advantage in the check. Approximate CR is 5, two more than a normal gargoyle.", "Blind sorceress uses bird familiar to see. When the bird is blinded, or taken out of commission she will use AOE attacks in an attempt to attack the party. If she has allies, they may be caught in the crossfire.

    "Orb of Planar Melding: This orb allows the user to overlap planes of existence through a complex ritual. Whether razing cities by combining it with the plane of fire, or using it to open up the world to an army of demons and undead, the scale provides dangerous power. Destroyed by: utilizing the orb to combine opposites such as the Positive and Negative Energy planes, or Feywild and Shadow Planes together, the artifact will implode taking a radius of 200 ft with it.", "Ark of Famine: At first glance, this wooden box appears much like a child’s coffin – a long wooden box, completely unadorned, full of sand and designed to be carried by two pallbearers using handles over the shoulders. However, the Ark houses the collective spirits of those killed by hunger and crop blights long ago. Drawing on these spirits, the Ark consumes any and all crop or plant matter in a maddened hunt for nourishment. Destroyed by: Wherever it goes, any plant matter or food within 300 feet is destroyed and cannot be recovered. Prying the Ark open and filling it with water will destroy it.", "Heart of Magic: The still beating heart of one of the most powerful sorcerers who ever lived. The magic in their blood still powers the heart. The heart can be used as a spellcasting focus, and when used as such, all spells made with the heart count as two levels above the level of the spellslot used. Flaw- the heart is still unstable, and all physical damage done directly to the heart causes the heart to violently react. When this happens, the heart gives off a violent blast of magical energy, dealing radiant damage equivalent to the original attack in a 20ft radius sphere. If attacked by necrotic damage this ability does not trigger, and the heart takes double damage. Destroyed by: The heart has 100 HP total. If the heart reaches 0 due to physical damage, it violently collapses, dealing 10d10 radiant damage in a 300ft sphere. If the heart reaches 0 due to necrotic damage, the heart slowly begins to shrivel up, until it is about the size of a grape, at which point it collapses into dust.", "Eldritch Rod: Created by an unknowable primordial deity, it appears to be composed of dark oak into the shape of a long tendril. While the wielder may use it to have an additional 10 spell slots, any spell cast through it will have a wild effect to it of an evil nature. The woes of the user do not end there however, the rod with also wrap around the wrist of the caster permanently until a way to remove it is found. The longer one is attached, the more evil and chaotic in nature they will become, slowly connecting their mind to that of the incomprehensible deity that created the rod. This link could have it omniscient benefits however if the user seeks to please their new god. Destroyed by: The cursed wielder must cut off the arm that is binded, burning it along with the cursed artifact. If it is simply burned without sacrifice the character will have angered the deity, if it is not purified in flame the mental link will remain.", "Gravestone of Decay: By chiseling a name of a person, place, or concept into the stone, it will begin to wither away across the material plane and die. A person will take minutes, whereas a city could take months or years, and entire concepts (freedom, justice, etc.) could take centuries. Destroyed by: The only way to destroy it is for someone to selflessly carve their own name into the stone.", "The Key: It looks and feels very much like a normal key, but emits an intense magical aura. The key can open any door in existence. It can even be used, to create and open a door out of thin air that leads to where it’s user desires. It’s more than a mere teleport. It can be used to enter a parallel room in which the user is able to see the world without anyone seeing him. He can’t collide or interact with anything in the “real” world though. Even traveling between universes and realities is possible. The magical power can also be used to cast spells. Destroyed by: Since once you’ve unlocked a normal door, it stays unlocked, the doors that the Key opens stay open until you have left back through the door you have created. Thus, the only way to destroy the Key would be to open the room where you are unable to interact with anything, and then leave the key in that room, and then close the door. This would render the key stuck in a place which no longer exists. Bonus points for going into multiple layers of that room and leaving it deeper.", "The Rift Sigil: A sigil of an arcane rune, which, when placed on a surface creates a hole which expands 1d10 feet in all directions each week. The hole is an extradimensional rift which consumes objects and creatures that it encounters: the passage is one way, and creatures and objects that pass through it are destroyed. A creature may willingly enter the hole: a creature that does so survives the trip, as their willpower keeps them from being consumed by the void on the other side. They take 1d10 psychic damage per minute while here. Destroyed by: A runestone exists inside this realm: it is sentient, and has the following statistics. Rift Sigil Rune: AC 18, HP 100, SPD 0 S:10 D:10 C:18 I:22 W:22 C:22 Damage Immunities: Bludgeoning, Slashing, and Piercing damage made by nonmagical weapons, and psychic damage.

On a critical hit, the victim must make a DC 15 CON save or die, drained to a husk. The wielder gets 1d4 temporary HP each time it kills someone with a spear.

Or an undead: it can’t drink from the undead.", "Heart of Gold: An artifact that if the user holding it kills an unwilling good oriented user, all evil oriented characters in the nearby vicinity have a one in (number) chance of becoming increasingly good natured depending on how much good of a person the sacrifice was (up to DM’s discretion). However, this also works the other way around. Introduction: The protagonist could be either extreme good or extreme evil character killing like-oriented individuals. The PCs then find out about the heart. Destroyed by: The heart loses HP for each willing participant (depending on how much of a good or bad person they were). The heart originally starts with 1HP but increases with every unwilling participant of the ritual by 1 point.", "The Orb of Omniscience: Like a crystal ball with telepathy but anybody can use it any number of times per day. Best not to be destroyed, best if the party takes it for their own use. Destroyed by: Can be melted in lava.", "Sarcophagus of Rejuvenation: This ancient sarcophagus has incredible regenerative properties. Spending a short rest inside it restores all hitpoints and cures minor diseases. Spending a 8h inside of it can bring a man back from the brink of death, regenerate limbs and halt aging. Spending time inside of it without any injuries starts to drain a person’s humanity and they move closer to chaotic evil alignment. Destroyed by: The sarcophagus power can be disabled by placing a wonderus item of legendary power that’s intent is to cause harm. After that the sarcophagus is able to be destroyed by a magical weapon.", "Metallurgist’s Bible: This ancient book conveys upon it’s user the ability to make masterworks of war. Any weapon crafted with this artifact’s knowledge does double the amount of damage dice (1d6 shortsword –> 2d6). To retain this feature, the weapon must be soaked in the blood of an ancient red dragon once a year. Destroyed by: For every point of damage it takes, it immediately heals the same amount, and conjures a spectral weapon that seeks out it’s attacker and does the same amount of damage back. The only way to destroy it is to burn it in the fires of the forge where it’s first weapon was created.", "Clockwork Heart: While in the process of creating the Modrons, Primus created a clockwork heart. Since this heart wasn’t useful to making the Modrons he set it aside and forgot about it. In order to attune to this artifact you must hold it pressed to your heart during a short rest. The artifact slowly enters your chest and fuses with your heart. Unattuning kills the person because the artifact can’t be unfused from their heart. While attuned to this artifact you have advantage on death saving throws. Also you can open up a portal that leads to the plane of Mechanus or back to the material plane from Mechanus once per day. Modrons recognize Primus’ creation and will avoid fights with the person attuned the clockwork heart unless they are attacked. Once a creature has attuned to the Clockwork Heart, they begin to gradually lose the ability to feel emotion and instead become more logical. The process is slow, but speeds up significantly whenever an aspect of the heart is used (such as opening a portal to Mechanus or making a death saving throw only because of the advantage provided by the artifact). At the end of the process, the creature will be completely unable to experience any emotion and will become a logic-centered being. Destroyed by: The heart most be brought to a plane of chaos, tainting it. Once the heart is tainted, it can be destroyed as a normal object.", "The Ring of Infinite Wisdom: While wearing this ring you can tap into some of it’s infinite wisdom by sucking your thumb. While you are tapping into the ring’s wisdom in this way your current wisdom score increases by 10 up to 30 temporarily, and you even receive premonitions of the future. Destroyed by: The ring can only be destroyed in a 10 minute bath in the tub of the demon prince of foolishness.", "The Brain Staff: A long wooden staff with a pink orb on one end. It can efortlessly control the minds of any monster it’s user desires, and is able to control an infinite number of creatures at once. The user can give it simple instructions that the beast will follow until the day it dies, and keep commanding it. Destroyed by: The Staff is also able to control the minds of creatures emotionally bound to people, like pets and familiars. However, the person who the creature was bound with can attempt to break the spell by making the monster recognize him/her (which would take some time and Wisdom checks). When that happens, both the staff and it’s user are overpowered and explode in a 300 feet radius.",
    "The Infinite Locket: This mysterious pendant, when viewed, takes the viewer to a realm of their own memories, where they relive their favorite memories. The pendant slowly drains them of their life until nothing remains. Destroyed by: Must be opened and viewed to work. Because it can’t move, it’s very easy to become lost. If somebody closes the pendant, the spell is broken, but the victim is left with a feeling of longing.", "The Mark of Ancestry: This wrapping bonds to the user, allowing them commune with all those who have bore the mark before. They lend the user their wisdom and muscle memory, allowing the user to perform feats beyond that of their skill. Destroyed by: The mark technically steals a portion of the user’s soul when used. Additionally, if the mark becomes unbonded from a user, that user can never bond with the mark again, as their soul has already been collected.", "The Machiavellian Mirror: The Machiavellian Mirror allows viewers to cast spells through it or freely scry on any location or being the viewers are knowledgeable of. The mirror itself can also cast various mind control spells on targets visible in the mirror at the user’s behest (DM’s discretion on which and the number of uses per day). The insidiousness is multiplied because the mirror’s control is such that targets may not realize that they were influenced by a spell, especially if they were only instructed to do reasonable things. The mirror can even be used to disadvantage the charisma and wisdom saving throws of targets visible in it if needed. Other Suggestions: The Machiavellian Mirror’s owner should be intelligent and paranoid, someone who takes all sorts of mundane and magical precautions to prevent the mirror from being visible and even having a reflection, especially when not in use. The owner should also take precautions to make sure they are knowledgeable of even potential threats, and that they are visible and findable at all times (e.g. command a ring of spies). Destroyed by: If the Machiavellian Mirror can “see” its own reflection clearly, (e.g. another mirror or smooth surface polished finely is brought into close range in appropriate lighting conditions), the mirror spontaneously smashes itself into smithereens and becomes useless. Viewing another mirror through the Machiavellian Mirror does not count.", "Seed of Iron: As the first seed of the first iron-wood tree, the small seed holds the power of a strong nature deity. Whenever the seed is allowed to touch dirt, the seed immediately burrows into the earth. In a 2000ft radius, a forest of iron wood trees will begin to grow. They require no water and will dig through anything in their way. When the forest is done growing, a small tree made entirely of iron will appear in the center of the forest.

Destroyed by: It can only be broken by those who have broken free from the rod’s will. Once you restrain yourself from the rod’s call to impulse, snapping the rod in two is as simple as finding the holder.", "Chalice of Plenty: A solid gold wine chalice encrusted with a diamond and ruby rim. The one who possesses this item will find themselves increasingly successful in matters of finance and trade. The chalice influences its owner to become increasingly gluttonous in all aspects, to the point of eventual demise.

To fully destroy the item, the wielder must adopt an ascetic lifestyle and resist temptation until their death, upon which the chalice will melt down into liquid gold and evaporate.", "The Crown of Hosts: A silver crown with six vertical ornate peaks that reach straight up one foot, each inset with a translucent green sphere. Each sphere houses the trapped spirit of a spellcaster that slightly glows within. The wearer of the crown must be a spellcaster and can command the spirits to cast whatever spells they knew in life. This can be potentially devastating, allowing 6 actions, plus the spellcaster’s, per turn. The wearer knows the power level of each of the spirits, but does not know the exact number of spells they had memorized when they died. The trapped spirits regenerate spells at the usual rate afterwards. Destroyed by: If any of the trapped spellcasters uses its last spell, it is immediately freed. The soul of the wearer of the crown is sucked into the vacant gem and becomes its new slave.", "The Cornucopia Of Plentiful Harvest: A small wooden cornucopia, which, at the dawn of each day, fills itself magically with whatever food the possessor desires.

Destroyed by: The Jest is easily torn, if the user can pass a DC 20 will save (read the Jest on Failure).

It still drips as if recently removed from the river that created it. It has been imbued with the power and fury of the river. When water is dropped onto it, the rock accelerates the water into a powerful stream which has the power to erode any non-magical surface. Combined with the Create Water spell, the effects can be devastating. Locks cut through in seconds, buildings eroded to the foundation in minutes, landscapes sculpted in hours, mountain passes cut in days. Used offensively, the jets of water can do serious damage to anyone foolish enough to get in the way. Destroyed by: If Destroy Water is cast upon it while it is not carried, the stone will erode into a fine sand. Alternatively, placing the stone back into the river where it was created will cause the stone to erode.", "Devil’s Crown: Summons and enslaves fiends. Radiant damage is doubled against the wearer.

It’s a small, pebble-like smooth dark brown hunk of wood, as it has been through countless owners throughout the beginning of time; if examined closely, flecks of what could be described as “black glass slivers” seem to pulse through the wood. Destroyed by: the more “resurrections”, the less memories the user has (a set number between player and DM, which can go up any number between play sessions, but cannot go up if the Wood was used during a play session). When the user cannot remember who they are, they are turned into an unsaveable, unresurrectable zombie, that can only be killed by normal means (re: immune to magics).", "Time’s Hourglass: This item bonds to the first person to touch it. Once that person dies, the item becomes able to bond again. The user may activate the hourglass, and a small portion of sand will run out, allowing them to perceive time in reverse, and thus, changing the future.

The next time they see any evil creature, they will be compelled to strike them down. In addition to this, the mace become a +2 and does 2d6 damage to any evil creature. Upon killing an evil individual, they must make another wisdom save. If they fail, the mace becomes a +3 weapon and the wielder is compelled to kill any neutral or evil creature it sees from there on out, behaving more like a bloodthirsty monster than a humanoid. If they kill 20 creature, they transform into either an imp or a dretch (their choice) and can never use the mace again. Destroyed by: The mace has no power over someone until they kill a fiendish or abyssal creature. After this, removing the mace from the person’s possession and casting lesser restoration will cure them. After they kill a neutral creature, a greater restoration spell will be needed. However, they will have an urge to get back to the mace for 1d6 days after a restoration spell is cast.", "The Statue of Ananamura: This 3 foot pure-silver statue of a dragon shines with radiance in the day time and any aristocrat would love to have it. But this is not so at night.

Those who pray to the moon are unaffected by this drain, but doing so permanently charms the supplicant to treat the moon cult as friends to be trusted and allies to be obeyed. (This effect overcomes usual resistances to charm) An ominous moon that never rises or sets is draining the mental and physical vitality of those in its range to fuel the birth of a false god. There is quite a bit of time before the moon-egg hatches, but scholars of esoteric mystery believe the draining effect will become worse, and moon will eventually draw in every living thing for a thousand miles with a siren call so they can be drained to nothing. Destroyed by: Kill the moon! The cult’s base is an ancient pike-like tower of wondrous metal directly below the false moon.
