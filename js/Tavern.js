There are no stools or seats at the bar. No one will be getting backstabbed at this establishment.", "Knee high platforms crisscross the tavern floor so that the Halfling servers can easily fill mugs and clear tables. It does make for a tripping hazard for tall folk, so watch yer step. Anyone involved in a bar brawl will have disadvantage on attack rolls.", "This tavern reeks of pickled fish. The owner cures them himself and sells them to travelers in sealed clay pots. The pots do little to mask the odor.", "An elaborate tapestry hangs behind the bar. Rumor has it that there are secret symbols and writings embroidered into the pattern. Some say it's a treasure map. Others say it's magical incantations for powerful spells. And others claim it hides the password for a secret society. The barkeep says she just thought it was pretty.", "A life sized statue behind the bar of a human man covering his eyes is supposedly the original owner of the tavern. Legend has it he fell in love with a Medusa and she accidentally turned him to stone. Many spellcasters over the years have tried to reverse the condition, yet failed.", "The owner is a Firbolg. Tables are ten feet high. The chairs have ladders attached so shorter patrons can reach their drinks. The smallest mug holds a gallon of ale. A bowl of soup can feed a family of six humans.", "The proprietor of the tavern is a shifty old dwarf, always looking over his shoulder and scanning the room. Occasionally he is spotted speaking to the bar itself as he wipes down the counter top. Whenever the fire in the hearth is dying, he runs his hand over the mantle, whispers to it in a comforting manner before the entire building shudders, creaks, strains, before letting out a groaning exhale and the fire is revitalized. Some believe the tavern itself is living.", "A weird contraption occupies an arcade that appears to be a slanted table, enchanted with fairy—and perhaps mechanical— lights. A spring propells a ball that is hastened and bounces around interacting with a tableux of pixies, live pixies, darting around doing pointless tasks under a glass surface. The tavernkeep calls it a 'pinball machine'. The current highscore is held by a person with the acronym BBEG.", "An enchanted lute provides a musical accompaniment to the tavern. It has a respectable repertoire, but one string is out of tune, making concentration checks difficult. The tavern owner despises bards, having his paramour swept off by one. So anyone offering to retune the lute might be met with violence.", "A dog. A friendly one. The unusual thing is that everyone sees the dog differently. A highlander Barbarian sees the dog as a longhaired red highland setter, but a Wood-Elf might see the dog as a black wolfhound, and a mountain Dwarf might see it as a small rat-terrier. This difference is unlikely to be noticed at the time, and only comes up during conversation later, after leaving the tavern.", "There are 5 doors around the bar each opens up to a different city and destroying an outside building does nothing but move the portal to a different building in said city.

All wood fittings have been burned to a blackened tone, and a large sign suggests any magic usage will lead to a ban from all establishments in the area. People are often thrown out for appearing to use magic, even if they aren’t. The tavern is that gun-shy.", "The bar is staffed with retired 'adventurers'.

Half-Orc or...is that a baby?", "While normal appearing from the outside, inside the bar and tables are all moulded from one tree, which is rooted in the bar and has carefully been bent and flattened over hundreds of years to serve as a bar and tables. The tree is still alive and growing, with a leaf sprouting here and there.", "The entire tavern is curiously dusty, despite being well attended, some areas look like they have a decade of dust upon them. If dust is swept off an empty table, all regulars will groan, and a large number of days written in chalk on the bar will be wiped off.", "The mugs are enchanted to refill themselves when you snap your fingers. You still get charged for the refills though.", "The tavern is a renovated monastery. The grounds were hallowed such that the entire area is magically silent. Patrons come from near and far for the extraordinary peace and quiet it offers.

The Halfling is the owner, and not a very talented musician.", "The bar is situated on a pier, and has a lower level where patrons can fish and let their feet sit in the water, where small fish nibble on the skin harmlessly. The cook will fry up anything you catch for free!", "A lonely, windswept tavern on the coast is situated a little closer to the sea than the rest of the village. Behind the bar there 's a thin-toothed comb made out of a shell, and the bartender tends to become gloomy if asked about it.", "A tavern made by a master dwarven stonemason, each table and stool is a fully piece of stonework, which slides glassily across the floor on clever grooves hidden in the floor. Given a few minutes, you can arrange every table in the place into one long feast table, with the tables making a sort of zig-zag line.", "Strict No Adventurers policy-time for some Charisma checks.", "A friendly mastiff hound wanders around the tavern begging at tables for snuggles and scritches. Any adventurer that feeds it a piece of meat will find that the dog will make its way outside toward a treasure chest hidden in the dirt outside.", "A tavern tucked away in one of the hottest regions of Avernus. It’s name is the Icebox, and it is owned by a devil who has bound an ice elemental into eternal servitude. This tavern has a fireplace containing a magical blue flame that radiates cold, rather than heat. This same blue flame is also behind the bar, beneath an iron grate upon which several mugs sit. This keeps them frosty cold, and makes this tavern an area favorite. Devils like to visit here for a change of scenery.", "A coastal tavern built from a kraken’s skull. It’ s name is The Little Fish. This tavern is frequented by wild storytellers, who tell the truth about 25 % of the time.", "A 2-story tavern with a strange reputation, where patrons must pay a steep fee up front before entering. Once inside, players will see a strange black liquid dripping from several holes in the ceiling, which is being collected in large barrels beneath them. Patrons dip their mugs into these barrels and drink the liquid, which is delicious and quite intoxicating. Rumor has it that this liquid is the blood of a demon who is imprisoned upstairs. No one is allowed upstairs to find out.", "A tavern called 'The View' built right next to a beautiful but very loud waterfall. The tavern owner thought it was a smart business move to build next to the waterfall, but you can barely hear anything inside over the roar of the waterfall only meters away from the front door.", "All patrons must check their weapons at the door of this tavern, much like a coat check. You are given a numbered ticket and the weapon is stored away in a back room behind a curtain. Unbeknownst to the players, this tavern is notorious for 'accidentally' replacing high quality or magical weapons that have been checked with inferior duplicates.", "All the food and drink have a slightly off taste. Not to the point of inedibility, but enough to notice something's off about it. When asked the bartender just smiles and says everything's spiced with a 'special ingredient' here. An investigation will reveal the barkeep raises snails and uses their slime as a staple ingredient in all of the food. He uses the slime from his favorite snails for his regulars.", "The ceiling of the tavern is very high up, and rather than walk around the tables servers descend from above in a complicated harness system. Sometimes, when nobody's looking, a hook will descend and pull up especially drunk patrons.", "The owner/bartender was a merchant for many years and can't reset a good haggle. A large chalkboard behind the bar displays a list of the lowest prices customers have managed to get out of him this evening, complete with a chalk portrait of the current #1 cheapskate.", "Each table is attached to a little boat that floats down a man-made underground water course. Patrons are offered the choice between the tunnel of love or the waterfall course at the entrance.", "A strange tavern that appears only in the most remote places. Wanderers May enter and find other adventurers from far off places just as confused as they are. There is no tavern keeper but hot food and drink is ready on the tables and the kitchen is open for those who cook. The upstairs rooms have comfy beds with silk sheets and fur blankets.The strangers are allowed one night to rest and feast with one another as they tell tales of their adventures and the bizarre places they’ve found the tavern. Come morning the party will awaken in a clearing where the tavern once stood. The strangers are gone and they are all awaken clean and refreshed.", "One of the servers looks a bit like a monkey, their arms dragging on the floor. On closer inspection... She is a monkey. You might not always get exactly what you ordered, but if you dare complain this monkey will show their teeth, and you really don't want to fight her.", "This tavern is completely made out of ice. Even the glasses are carved from ice. The food is pretty cold too. If a fight breaks out, for every move action, make a dex saving throw or slip (become prone).", "When you come in, you're in luck: there's exactly enough seats left for your party! Turns out this tavern scales with the number of patrons in it, and is always exactly big enough to have that bustling, slightly cramped tavern feel. The servers and cooks are real however, so if too many people come in at once, you might have to wait for your meal for a bit!", "This rather expensive, high-end tavern serves dozens of traditional clay oven dishes. All of these are hand - made by the clay warforged bartender, straight from the oven embedded in their chest.", "Beverage faucets are fashioned to resemble a wooden snake spitting the liquid out.", "Area of the bar uses oddly shaped sitting areas and tables to allow for centaurs or other non - humanoid races to be there.", "Main area of the bar is designed like a circle so that there are no corners of the bar for edgy people to brood in.", "Tavern secretly hides 10 coin-sized wooden emblems across it every morning. If you find one, you can exchange it for a bottom-shelf drink of your choice. Tavern's decorated enough that there are many spots for these to be hidden in. Players can find these with perception/search checks, with them being more likely to find them the earlier in the morning it is (as less of them have already been found).", "The menu(or barkeep/barmaid) insist on pairing everything on the menu with a spiced meat. You want ale? There's a meat for it. Wine? There's a meat for it. You just want to order some gruel and be left alone? Too bad! There's a meat for that!", "Soft music fills the room, just over the din of the occupants. Each patron, however, hears a different tune/instrument to fit their mood/preference.", "The wait staff are all benevolent changelings that shift a slight detail every time they leave direct sight. For example: they first meet a blonde, mustachioed barkeep. When he returns with drinks, he's clean shaven. He dips below the bar to fill from the tap and emerges with darker hair.", "This tavern is run by gnomes who have goliaths as slaves. The goliaths are completely cowed by their masters and their little tiny whips.", "Upon entering you must sign up to take part in a barroom brawl.People who arrive late have to take less desirable positions in the fight, such as 'first one to get thrown through the window.'", "If anyone orders anything other than the bartender’s personal brand of brew, all other patrons are allowed to throw darts at them.", "A cross shaped tavern with the bar in the middle, the PCs people always want to emerge from shadowy corners, this one has 8.", "Your food/drinks are brought to you via tortoise-literally the opposite of Fast Food", "Cats freely roam the Tavern looking for treats and cuddles.", "No chairs, we eat on the floor with low tables, prone, on your belly, propped up with your elbows.", "The tavern is segregated by race, you get a discount if you sit in your designated area, charged double if you don’t.", "The Tavern is floating on a lake in the middle of town?", "There is some strange skeleton mounted to the wall above the fireplace. Nobody knows what kind of creature it belongs to or where it came from, but it's been there for so long that patrons just accept and celebrate its existence.", "A massive, politically neutral tavern and inn that is enchanted to prevent any and all acts of violence within its walls. It allows patrons to rest free from conflict or worry, no matter what their political, religious, or racial affiliation. It may also serve as the perfect hideout for someone with enemies, provided that they remain in the tavern.", "One too many exotic-wood wall panels line her tavern's walls -- they slinky the halls, flipping from beam to beam so that they all tangentially fit. You have to wait until the door you walked through lines up with a wall panel before you can leave--the 24 clocks for the 24 doors to the 24 regions are listed by name on the wall next to the tricetails specials.", "You are sucked (resist: as Mighty or better) into the bar the moment you push on it.", "Rumour has it, you are to be either stupid drunk or else heavily caffeinated while you exit through the door because otherwise crossing its threshold causes a pounding headache that plays echoes of the pounding tavern walls throughout the rest of the day intensifying and diminishing with light levels (as: Light-Sensitive).", "A dwarves mechanic runs the bar and has a set of three automatons in the corner that when he presses a stone button under the bar they spring to life and start lifelessly playing a beautiful song. The bartender usually leaves it off and has a somber look whenever the tavern fills up and he puts them on.", "An ancient, but magical crossbow over the bar that has patrons split on whether or not it works or not (spoiler alert-it does), and rumors of the tavern owner's dangerous past. Bonus points if he is an elderly unassuming gentleman.", "The Any Port tavern has been enchanted so that, on the inside, it seems like there's a storm raging outside no matter the weather.", "Fake of a unique and well known artifact from the world. Half the visitors think it’s the real thing, while the other half are certain it’s not...", "The bar is managed by a wizard and their apprentices.

No one else knows about it or how it got there, but it can be found with Detect Magic and stolen.", "Drinking glasses are prismatic and more durable.

The tea possesses a bitter, spicy, and pungent aroma and is a potent stimulant, with its precise effects varying depending on method of preparation and the precise provenance of the khyr. The most commonly found type has the khyr being finely minced, dried, and pressed into bricks for easier storage and transport. This tea instills alertness and creativity with a slight sense of euphoria, making it a prized commodity amongst wizards, philosophers, and courtiers in many lands (albeit most prefer to add other things to mask the taste), and a major dwarven trade good.", "Forge-Fire - Whilst Khârt is a common beverage with not very much cultural significance to the dwarves, forge-fire is a brew steeped in ceremony, and it is only consumed by dwarven masters of a craft before undertaking a great endeavor, whether it be a warrior leading a charge against an enemy army, a runeworker making a gate impervious to ram or explosive, or a smith forging the armor of a king. The khyr used in forge-fire is of the highest quality, and the most prized for forge-fire is khyr found growing upon the graves of a dwarf's ancestors or prior masters of the art, as the dwarves believe those specific fungi are gifts from the ancestors and hold some of their skill. Forge-fire is prepared by the drinker in a ritual that takes around 6 hours, during which the dwarf meditates on their ancestors, their training and knowledge, and the magnitude of the task ahead. The tea itself is prepared rather strangely: the khyr is finely sliced and placed into a wide and shallow bowl (often an ornate heirloom) and over it is poured strong mushroom brandy. The mixture is set alight and the heat from the burning, along with the tincturing from the alcohol, produce the infusion. A final incantation is sung and the brew is drunk whilst it is still burning. The brew fills the user with single-minded focus and vigor, making their movements swift, sure, and tireless, with many under its effects being known to work without stopping for days or even weeks. However, the aftereffects are extremely unpleasant, almost as if their life energy itself has burned up, and often leave the dwarf bedridden for months, and those who have consumed it claim to have felt that they utterly lost themselves in the chorus of ancestors and the purity of the craft, . In all dwarven history, few have consumed the forge's flame thrice, and none have survived it.", "Corpses Caffeine - Made from the petals of a corpse flower. When crushed they can be turned into an orange paste that can be infused in hot water to make a bitter but smooth tea. This tea makes you more aware of dead organisms near you.", "Nature’s wake - Made from an old ritual flower used by Druid’s to talk to nature. The petals of this flower are a bright and luminous white but, when dropped in boiling water, the liquid turns black with patches of green. Stir for 10 minutes and drink in one sip is the recommended brewing and drinking time. If brewed and drank correctly, nature will keep you safe for 24 hours. Examples of this would be nature guiding you out of a forest, trees protecting you like a shield.", "Leafwalker's Sensation - Crushed and dried leaves and sprigs from a Dryad's very own branches. The taste isn't different from other green teas, but it's magical warmth will flood inside your throat and belly. If the ingredients were gifted from a dryad, this tea will nourish and soothe to your inner core -mind, body and soul- and awakens your connection to the Fey for a short while. Just don't drink any that was harvested from a dead or unwilling Dryad...", "Dragon’s Balm - Sometimes chewed, this spiky leaf is known to any wood-witch or hermit worth their salt - a common sight among roadside plants and overgrown gardens. When brewed the leaf gives off a strong smoky aroma - drinking it makes your breath smell slightly of woodsmoke and brimstone. The short term effects are as a mild stimulant - a particularly potent brew might help someone work tirelessly for several hours or walk twice as far in a day. Those under its effects seem artificially chipper and may talk more than they mean to. The aftereffects are marked; a mild and not unpleasant lethargy usually followed by a deep and untroubled sleep. Valued by travelers and those living in peaceful locales for its use in travel and ease in ensuring a full night’s rest, the wise avoid its use when danger looms or work must continue at great length - the sleep of Dragon's Balm is difficult to rouse from and the lethargy lasts until the body is allowed to completely rest. Repeated use runs the risk of dependence, and the tea will begin staining the teeth orange over time.", "Ghostflower Tea - Used by mediums and those who wish to commune with the dead - this tea must be prepared in a special ritual lasting an hour. The ritual involves selecting the proper leaves and bulbs from this unassuming but rare white-gold flower and painstakingly removing the tiny black pods that spread from the flower’s open bell. Each pod must be shucked and its contents ground, but when the tea is finally imbibed the user can interact with and speak to the dead. The imbiber will be wreathed in a soft glow for the duration, and appear translucent under moonlight. Given a strong enough dose, they will be able to pass through flimsier solid objects - this effect is rare and taking too much Ghostflower tea is dangerous. The dead become attracted to those who drink this tea; an unlucky medium may drink to speak to a lost loved one or question a murder victim or ancient lord only to find themselves the focus of every unquiet dead or revenant for miles around. Drinking poorly prepared tea or drinking two doses in a single changing of the moon (a month) can give the imbiber intense visual hallucinations and make them violently ill; they have been known to speak at length to visions of their dead loved ones or ancestors and carry out battles against imaginary foes. The skin of a victim of Ghostflower poisoning will be pale and flushed; the blood will not clot and they bleed freely. Those with weak constitutions may perish. Individuals who die while under the effects of ghost flower tea are more likely to become spirits themselves.", "Moon Tea - Brewed by witches, midwives, queens and bachelors - this tea is from an uncommon leafy plant of green-grey leaves. Bitter smelling but sweet on the tongue, having two cups of this at most an hour before coitus will prevent pregnancy. Some claim it heightens sensation and others that it ages the body, but when taken by any sex its efficacy is renowned. Babies born from unions where one or both parent take this tea are considered lucky by many, and the child of such a union is often marked by green flecks in their eyes. This plant is harvested so regularly that what was once a common sight in every garden and back patio has become a valuable commodity; this is because improper harvesting yields sufficient quantities for a dose while killing this fragile plant.", "Willwillown - a common long leaf tea that grows on hillsides and is hardy. Usually drunk as a before midday tea but has several flavored varieties by mixing it with florals like Rill or Munlack or Pepper Flower, or with citrus peels. Gnomes like it baked rather than air dried as it rounds out the body, but they also brew it strong and tanneny which others find unpleasant. Dwarves will sometimes chew Willwillown berries but humans find them bitter and unpalatable.", "Moradin's Loose Leaf - Made from the leaves of Ironwood and a proprietary blend of black tea leaves steeped in a forge's quenching bucket. Gives the drinker renewed vigor to continue hammering, bending and cutting long past many of the younger dwarves.", "Avlat - Made from leaves of a vine that grows wild in poor soil. Brews a peppery, copper-colored tea that is a bit of an acquired taste, but often is used to accentuate other bold flavors, such as those found in rich wines, sauces, and ales.", "Beorunna's Cure-All Named, oddly enough, for a legendary barbarian queen credited with its discovery, this bitter-tasting tea made from boiled stems located in the Savage Frontier has taken on an austere reputation among healers and herbalists. The first time a creature that consumes this tea regains hit points from any source in the following hour, they regain 2d4 additional hit points.", "Blackthorn - Brewed from the leaves of the blackthorn shrub, producing a savory tea with earthy woody notes, and a fruity, tangy aftertaste. This tea is known to calm an upset stomach, and is remarkably common in the Dragon Coast and Dragon Reach.", "Blueleaf - Harvested from the leaves of the bitterhedge plant, plentiful throughout the Realms and used to ward off common crop parasites. When brewed, creates an off-blue tea that is slightly sweet with an almost minty aftertaste. Many enjoy this tea recreationally, though used medicinally it suppresses nausea and dysentery for 8 hours after consumption.", "Chalthorn - Made from grey, furry weeds that plague farmers in Sembia and the Dalelands, this cloudy tea has a dry, chalky taste that is difficult to like. However, when a creature drinks this tea, it becomes unable to taste spice in food for one hour, rendering the most spicy of cuisine palatable.", "Coffee - A potent drink with a bold, robust yet bitter flavor, energizing to those that drink it. A creature cannot sleep or be put to sleep by any means for an hour after drinking coffee.", "Coffee, Dwarvish - A thick, sluggish liquid, almost syrupy in texture and black as midnight. It is doubtful if any actual coffee beans are involved. For 8 hours after drinking dwarvish coffee, a creature cannot sleep or be put to sleep by any means.", "Earth Dragon's Eye - A rich black tea from Shou Lung in Kara-Tur, slightly acerbic, with a complex earthy aroma. Drinking this tea refreshes you and loosens your muscles, increasing your land movement speed by 5 feet for the next hour.", "Elkammat - Brewed from groundnut husks found in Murghôm, Semphar, Mulhorand, Unther, and Chondath, this brown tea has a woody, bitter, and slightly nutty flavor. Typically served spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, or more esoteric spices, this tea warms the heart and engenders positive feelings in those who drink it. The drink of choice for the entire eastern Inner Sea.", "Feverbalm - This tea is brewed from small multi-colored red, black, and yellow flowers found in the Savage Frontier. Drinking this tea calms the mind and numbs the throat and tongue, suppressing any madness effects the character suffers for one hour.", "Gaeth'ad - A tea brewed by the orcs of the Shadow Marches, tasting thick and brackish, with a flavor that stays on the tongue. A versatile if incredibly pungent drink, it can be  brewed as a mild stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic, depending on methods used when brewing.", "Jethur - Purplish and (usually) as savory as broth, this tea is made from dense clusters of fungi known as carpet mushrooms. The taste of this tea is known to shift as one drinks it, and it is renowned by merchants for its ability to induce sobriety and soothe digestion. A creature that drinks this tea suppresses the effects of any alcohol in their system for 2 hours.", "Long Jing - A rich and fragrant green tea, grown in Kara-Tur’s Zhejiang province. Tradition holds that this tea can help cleanse the body of toxins, granting a creature that drinks it resistance to poison damage for one hour after consumption.", "Mallow - This light blue floral tea is popular in Maztica, often finding use as a sleep aid. It carries a light semi-sweet taste. If a creature drinks this tea before sleeping, they sleep free of nightmares and cannot be affected by the dream spell or similar abilities.", "Meiriath - A rich copper-colored beverage tasting of mango and citrus, popular with wealthy residents of Halruaa, Unther, and Mulhorand. Made from carefully-dried leaves of cave-sedge, a grass-like plant that grows in caves and other dark places.", "Mother's Leaf - A mellowing concoction, carrying with it strong grass and sage notes, a staple of healers in the Savage Frontier. If a creature that drinks this tea suffers from any diseases, they can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 13. On a success, one disease the creature suffers ends gradually after 24 hours. A creature can only attempt this saving throw once, requiring a long rest before attempting it again.", "Mourningberry - Traditionally found near graves and other deathly places, the leaves and flowers of this plant can be seeped into a tea, but its berries are mildly toxic. When brewed, the tea acts as a slight depressant, relaxing those that drink it and making them disinterested in conflict or confrontation. Often served ceremonially at funerals.", "Nararoot - A shaved-down tuber seeped into a tea, its natural licorice flavor is softened into a musky semi-sweet aroma. This tea functions as a form of birth control; a female humanoid that drinks this tea is rendered infertile for a period of 2 weeks. A similar tea for male humanoids is derived from cassil, though that tea costs 10 gp for every 1/20 lb.", "Pale Jade - A light and airy white tea, cultivated in Kara-Tur, primarily within Shou Lung. A popular export, many merchants and tea connoisseurs hold this tea as an excellent introduction to proper tea drinking.", "Par-Salian's Blend - A smoky, citrus-rich blend of herbs that soothes the throat, passed down between the magi of Krynn. If a creature drinks this tea, it suppresses any conditions that cause a hacking cough for 24 hours.", "Sandberry - These yellow berries grow in the Western Heartlands, proliferating in otherwise barren and ravaged areas. Tea brewed from these berries is yellow in color and has a harsh, bitter, and acidic taste, but nevertheless is favored by travelers as an excellent source of hydration in arid lands.", "Talkuth - Made from groundleaf, a hardy plant that is one of the few things which can survive the bitter cold of the North. This tea is slate grey with a metallic tang, and is generally considered unpalatable to those not used to consuming it.", "Tal, blackroot - Brewed by the halflings of Khorvaire’s Talenta Plains, this beverage is served piping hot and carries a taste of bitter cinnamon.

Popular for its use in settling the stomach, and its warm, slightly spicy taste.", "Yellowleaf - Concocted from the undried, sword-shaped leaves of the idaya weed, this tea is remarkably common throughout the Shining South. It has a robust and dependable taste, and a pale yellow coloration. Though traditionally served hot, cold yellowleaf tea can be used to remove most stains from clothing and other textiles.",

After removing the electric glands and other organs, the meat of a Behir should be either smoked or roasted. Most adventurers miss out on the best flavour of this mountain dwelling creature.

Combining the jelly of a gelatinous cube with copious amounts of cheese and wine over high heat, you are able to neutralize most of the acidic elements to create an amazing dish. A mild anesthetizing effect tickles and numbs the mouth, preventing speech for a minute after consumption. Some consider this a boon and it is a frequent dish at many upper-class family reunions.", "Flesh Fondgoo: Captured by a human from beyond the stars with an unnatural hunger, the chef only had servitude as a survival option. Becoming comforter and preparer of meals, the new take on the fondgoo proved to be delectable with the right ingredients. Thin slices of half-orc proved to be the most popular with the star cannibal and his crew, wildly rich with only mild game flavor from the mixed heritage. The gourmet would never admit it to anyone, but his refined palate preferred the gnoll. The terror only ended after discovering what they thought was a holy grail, a Hungering Flesh that went from cornucopia to consumer in no short order.", "Roasted Phoenix: When you’re done, you toss the bones in the fire and *pop* the phoenix is back. Also, you can always cook it just right; if you keep going, then it loops rare through well done.", "Forever Stew: made with a bit of troll meat which is still regenerating.

As such, it’s often sought out by adventurers tired of eating the same old dried meat when on the road.", "Dry Stirge: this is a common folk food. In places with Stirge infestations, meat is often spoiled as these tiny creatures suck all of its blood and nutrients. Because of that, locals recur to it to replace their meat.

The Heat immune properties of the Remorhaz become fallible after their death, but they still require extremely high temperatures to be able to cook. Think smelting furnace, not oven.

Gets rather testy if people mention checkers. The staff are construct automatons that only move like particular chess pieces. Complains about a completely irrational rival who sends him storms of nonsense letters every day.", "A professional human trick-shot-archer. She goes on tour with the circus now and then. Her favorite one is nailing a playing card out of someone’s hand from one hundred paces.", "A stout Dwarf who’s a master cook.

Recently took up horse-riding.", "A human comedian whose jokes tend to be at his own expense. Unmarried but pretty well-off, for a comedian. He tends to leave in the evening and come back close to midnight after his show.", "An eladrin priest of Tymora. Closer to his fey ancestry than most Eladrin. He’s scheming with a local gang to spring some of their hooligans from prison- after all, the whims of chance are unpredictable, or so he’ll say if the party threatens to inform the authorities. Then he will try and bribe them.", "A calm Oriental-looking man who works as a janitor during the day. His apartment isn’t exactly barren, but it’s certainly unextravagant. He’s teaching a local child the various martial arts he mastered in his time as a Monk.", "A simple Halfling herb-farmer. She has a small plot of land behind her house, where she grows things like spices and vegetables. Patient, because as she says, you can’t hurry peppers. Spends most of her time reading novels.", "A dragonborn tale-weaver. No, not an author, she’s quite firm. A tale-weaver, the kind that don’t get written down so much as passed along. Though she doesn’t exactly have it in writing, she’s very familiar with the wording and themes that make a riveting tale.", "A solemn, gods-fearing Dwarvish carpenter. They call him the Pious Benchmaker, which baffles him. His wife is of somewhat better cheer, but tolerates no nonsense in her house. The furniture is first-rate. You could hit it with a battle-hammer and it wouldn’t dent.", "An Aasimar mattress-maker. Laments his own misfortune: his mattresses are so good, he either sleeps on them and can’t get himself out of bed, or he sleeps on a couch or armchair and doesn’t sleep well. It’s a DC X Strength save to get off his guest-beds (the best ones, for he’s quite hospitable), where X is 10 plus the number of days since the sleeper has been in a normal bed instead of a bedroll or cot.", "A slightly unhinged half-orc scholar. He’s studying all sorts of bizarre phenomena at once, and keeps a wall covered in notes, sketches, and pieces of twine connecting them. The statistical anomalies of coin flips, the way the planet is tilted, all those sorts of things. Frequently becomes so engrossed in his studies he forgets to eat.", "A ratcatcher who is quite ferocious in his task. He’s got mousetraps all over the place, and hundreds of rat skulls nailed to his wall. Grim, adamant, and talks at length about what utter vermin rodents are.", "A friendly, jocular doppelganger illusionist and it’s tame mimic pets. The house appears to have a large staff of servants and much finely-made furniture…", "A gnomish Expert Clown. He doesn’t just study mere tossing and tumbling, mind you. He studies the psychology of clowning. What makes a pie to the face so funny? Or what is the thrill-inducing factor of juggling eggs? He can tell you. He can tell you for several hours.", "A human stone-carver and his teenage son. The son’s a little worried about his father, as the latter seems to be losing interest in the craft. Their house is full of half-finished works.", "A high elf mask-maker. It’s a delicate craft, she’ll tell you. Fey come to call every so often, picking up their masks but also staying to chat with her a bit. So do some actors. And one or two assassins.", "A scruffy human gravedigger. He isn’t exactly a philosopher, but tends to make incisive remarks about mortality and time. Doesn’t like elves, because they don’t give him business.", "An old man with a bald head and gleaming eyes. If asked, he only gives his profession as ‘chemist’, and spends a lot of time in his lab. He’s less harmless than he seems; he’s the master poison-brewer for a local assassin’s guild. If he’s found out, he calls in his allies on whoever discovered his true identity.", "A young couple of a Tiefling and an Aasimar. Their ancestors didn’t like the marriage much, and it couldn’t exactly get officiated by a priest (but the local marriage law did allow for a Fey to do the job). They’re getting along fine.", "A pious couple who are gravely concerned about their young daughter. She claims to see ‘shadowy people’ in the cellar, and apparently brought the family dog back to life. They’re both nearly nervous wrecks, and priests of every Good god have been coming and going all week to try and exorcise the child.", "A white-haired old man and his shrill wife, both the village healers, although the Mr. recently got fired by the prince whose father he used to work for.", "A playwright who is outraged at his rivals trying to spread the rumor that his work was ghostwritten for him. Insists on reading off sonnets and scenes to the guests to prove that he’s genuine.", "A grizzled, scarred town guard. He’s only in during the day, usually asleep, and spends the nights walking the streets and smoking very particular cheap cigars. Moody but not hostile.", "A ‘professional quest-giver’ who pampers the heroes with everything he can. He’s in kahoots with a local dungeon-lord, and gets a share of the armor, weapons and loot of the heroes killed in the dungeon he directs them towards. He’ll take to the hills if he’s found out.", "A young priestess of a god of the wilds. Her house is on the very outskirts of town, and has a terrible case of rats, which she doesn’t mind as long as they don’t bother the guests. Rats that do bother the guests get speared. She doesn’t take nonsense, but has some sense of humor.", "A Kenku minstrel who rents a room above the tavern he performs in. It’s covered in posters from his ‘glory-days’- although a keen eye (DC 15 Investigation) will note that they’re actually other bards’ posters, with the minstrel’s name altered into them.", "An apprentice baker and his wife, a schoolteacher. Their house was a cheap deal, and is a little run-down but still serviceable. Gets a little drafty, though.", "A Kobold who claims to be an architect and interior designer. Actually, she’s a dungeon planner who designs catacombs, lairs and castles galore. Highly sought-after by evil overlords, and frantically tries to direct them away while the guests are there. If she’s found out, she’ll flee to the safety of one of her closer creations.", "A Swordsmith who has been at it for years. He keeps a display case of splintered, shattered or blunted swords recovered from various dungeons and battlefields, each with the tale of a fallen hero attached to it.", "A halfling gourmand with an affinity for candies. He’s a longstanding foe of witches who use his creations, or mockeries thereof, to lure children into their cook-pots.", "A Dwarvish family of four- father, mother, son, daughter -who are rather new in town. Hospitable, but the house is still full of moving crates. The father is a lumberjack, the mother is a stay-at-home parent.", "The High Priest of a local shrine of the god of travelers and messengers. He’s an unmatched source of information, references and road maps, and will greet anybody with a smile so long as they return the favor.", "An old Elvish couple. The husband spends most of his time golfing or whittling, the wife is busy giving advice to her newly-married daughter. They live in a nice old house, although there’s a ghost in the attic.
