His house is littered with mounted modrons, dissected modrons, everything modron-related you could imagine.", "A time-wizard who messes with his personal time for kicks. Making himself twelve years old, being in four places at once. He thinks it’s a riot.

Apparently it’s about halflings and some kind of Ring?", "A razor-witted Dwarvish comedian who does standup at local taverns, dishing out the side-clutchers and knee-slappers galore. Willing to share a few jokes with the party, too. His ‘why did the cockatrice cross the road?’ always gets ’em.", "A Bugbear leg-breaker for the local mob is trying way too hard to be polite and gracious. His apartment’s nice, of course, but he seems to think that the entire party are some sort of sting operation.", "A former Underdark delver, this calm but dispassionate female Tiefling is married to a far more bubbly and cheery Wood Elf.

His house is above his tavern.", "An Eladrin woodcarver who has recently taken up trying to enchant things. She’s terribly confident it’ll work out eventually, but for now you’ll have to put up with wooden busts that hurl abuse or curse words and cutlery that work together to spell out rather rude slang.", "A Halfling balloonist with a terrible case of wanderlust.

Might cut the Evil Overlords off from his business if approached; he’s a man of principles, just needs a push of sorts to get him to stand his ground for them.", "An Aasimar teamster who’s moving into the song business. He’s got quite the voice, and a few songs already written: All Shook Up, 500 Miles, and he’s working on a few more.", "A slightly edgy Tiefling who wants to be both friendly and intimidating. Budding metalhead. His apartment is nearly plastered with band posters and song lyrics.", "A genteel, aristocratic Red Dragon who lives in an enormous castle.", "A curious young man enamored by the sea.

The husband is a little busy with an important order: a new crown for an anonymous nobleman.", "A halfling priest of various gods of knowledge and nature. He’s a part-time biologist, running a few experiments in the lab in his basement. He’d love to meet a Druid or Ranger with more hands-on experience than himself.", "A Fey who lives in a checkers-themed tower. May kick the guests out if they mention chess or use chess analogies. Most of the food is circular (pie, pancakes, etc.), the tablecloths and bedsheets all have checkered patterns. Writes long letters to a bitter rival.", "A Fey who lives in a chess-themed tower. Gets rather testy if people mention checkers. The staff are construct automatons that only move like particular chess pieces. Complains about a completely irrational rival who sends him storms of nonsense letters every day.", "A professional human trick-shot-archer. She goes on tour with the circus now and then. Her favorite one is nailing a playing card out of someone’s hand from one hundred paces.", "A stout Dwarf who’s a master cook. He puts his heart and soul into every slab of beef, taking hours just to prepare them for barbecuing. Doesn’t spend much time with the guests.",

Recently took up horse-riding.", "A human comedian whose jokes tend to be at his own expense. Unmarried but pretty well-off, for a comedian. He tends to leave in the evening and come back close to midnight after his show.", "An eladrin priest of Tymora. Closer to his fey ancestry than most Eladrin. He’s scheming with a local gang to spring some of their hooligans from prison- after all, the whims of chance are unpredictable, or so he’ll say if the party threatens to inform the authorities. Then he will try and bribe them.", "A calm Oriental-looking man who works as a janitor during the day. His apartment isn’t exactly barren, but it’s certainly unextravagant. He’s teaching a local child the various martial arts he mastered in his time as a Monk.", "A simple Halfling herb-farmer. She has a small plot of land behind her house, where she grows things like spices and vegetables. Patient, because as she says, you can’t hurry peppers. Spends most of her time reading novels.", "A dragonborn tale-weaver. No, not an author, she’s quite firm. A tale-weaver, the kind that don’t get written down so much as passed along. Though she doesn’t exactly have it in writing, she’s very familiar with the wording and themes that make a riveting tale.", "A solemn, gods-fearing Dwarvish carpenter. They call him the Pious Benchmaker, which baffles him. His wife is of somewhat better cheer, but tolerates no nonsense in her house. The furniture is first-rate. You could hit it with a battle-hammer and it wouldn’t dent.", "An Aasimar mattress-maker. Laments his own misfortune: his mattresses are so good, he either sleeps on them and can’t get himself out of bed, or he sleeps on a couch or armchair and doesn’t sleep well. It’s a DC X Strength save to get off his guest-beds (the best ones, for he’s quite hospitable), where X is 10 plus the number of days since the sleeper has been in a normal bed instead of a bedroll or cot.",
                "A slightly unhinged half-orc scholar. He’s studying all sorts of bizarre phenomena at once, and keeps a wall covered in notes, sketches, and pieces of twine connecting them. The statistical anomalies of coin flips, the way the planet is tilted, all those sorts of things. Frequently becomes so engrossed in his studies he forgets to eat.", "A ratcatcher who is quite ferocious in his task. He’s got mousetraps all over the place, and hundreds of rat skulls nailed to his wall. Grim, adamant, and talks at length about what utter vermin rodents are.", "A friendly, jocular doppelganger illusionist and it’s tame mimic pets. The house appears to have a large staff of servants and much finely-made furniture…", "A gnomish Expert Clown. He doesn’t just study mere tossing and tumbling, mind you. He studies the psychology of clowning. What makes a pie to the face so funny? Or what is the thrill-inducing factor of juggling eggs? He can tell you. He can tell you for several hours.", "A human stone-carver and his teenage son. The son’s a little worried about his father, as the latter seems to be losing interest in the craft. Their house is full of half-finished works.", "A high elf mask-maker. It’s a delicate craft, she’ll tell you. Fey come to call every so often, picking up their masks but also staying to chat with her a bit. So do some actors. And one or two assassins.", "A scruffy human gravedigger. He isn’t exactly a philosopher, but tends to make incisive remarks about mortality and time. Doesn’t like elves, because they don’t give him business.", "An old man with a bald head and gleaming eyes. If asked, he only gives his profession as ‘chemist’, and spends a lot of time in his lab. He’s less harmless than he seems; he’s the master poison-brewer for a local assassin’s guild. If he’s found out, he calls in his allies on whoever discovered his true identity.", 
                "A young couple of a Tiefling and an Aasimar. Their ancestors didn’t like the marriage much, and it couldn’t exactly get officiated by a priest (but the local marriage law did allow for a Fey to do the job). They’re getting along fine.", "A pious couple who are gravely concerned about their young daughter. She claims to see ‘shadowy people’ in the cellar, and apparently brought the family dog back to life.

Insists on reading off sonnets and scenes to the guests to prove that he’s genuine.", "A grizzled, scarred town guard. He’s only in during the day, usually asleep, and spends the nights walking the streets and smoking very particular cheap cigars. Moody but not hostile.", "A ‘professional quest-giver’ who pampers the heroes with everything he can. He’s in kahoots with a local dungeon-lord, and gets a share of the armor, weapons and loot of the heroes killed in the dungeon he directs them towards. He’ll take to the hills if he’s found out.", "A young priestess of a god of the wilds. Her house is on the very outskirts of town, and has a terrible case of rats, which she doesn’t mind as long as they don’t bother the guests. Rats that do bother the guests get speared. She doesn’t take nonsense, but has some sense of humor.", "A Kenku minstrel who rents a room above the tavern he performs in. It’s covered in posters from his ‘glory-days’- although a keen eye (DC 15 Investigation) will note that they’re actually other bards’ posters, with the minstrel’s name altered into them.", 
                "An apprentice baker and his wife, a schoolteacher. Their house was a cheap deal, and is a little run-down but still serviceable. Gets a little drafty, though.", "A Kobold who claims to be an architect and interior designer. Actually, she’s a dungeon planner who designs catacombs, lairs and castles galore. Highly sought-after by evil overlords, and frantically tries to direct them away while the guests are there. If she’s found out, she’ll flee to the safety of one of her closer creations.", "A Swordsmith who has been at it for years. He keeps a display case of splintered, shattered or blunted swords recovered from various dungeons and battlefields, each with the tale of a fallen hero attached to it.", "A halfling gourmand with an affinity for candies. He’s a longstanding foe of witches who use his creations, or mockeries thereof, to lure children into their cook-pots.", "A Dwarvish family of four- father, mother, son, daughter -who are rather new in town. Hospitable, but the house is still full of moving crates. The father is a lumberjack, the mother is a stay-at-home parent.", "The High Priest of a local shrine of the god of travelers and messengers. He’s an unmatched source of information, references and road maps, and will greet anybody with a smile so long as they return the favor.", "An old Elvish couple. The husband spends most of his time golfing or whittling, the wife is busy giving advice to her newly-married daughter. They live in a nice old house, although there’s a ghost in the attic.

Most of the main streets and markets are in our universe, but beware of entering strange doors or alleyways--they can leave you stranded in a parallel reality if you don't know how to find your way back. The city is filled with the ephemera of other universes: there is coinage bearing the faces of leaders and nations that never existed; there are books filled with spells and alchemical formulae that don't work here; there are pieces of magic and technology that are utterly unknown, and will cease to work if taken far from splinterpoint`, `this town was built on the back of a massive land snail.

He likes to get out and cause mischief though, whenever he can`, `this city has a large pedestal in the middle of downtown there a glass orb sits with an object inside. This object is constantly shifting form to resemble the various currencies of the world. Rumors circulate that if the orb is ever broken whatever currency it is currently in the form of will disappear world-wide, others say that if it is broken whatever currency it is in the form of will erupt forth from it. As a result of these and other rumors, the city guard and local mages college have formed a unified front to defend the orb from any attempt at breaking it open, though all attempts have proven ineffective since a visiting mage from a neighboring city experimented by dropping an elephant on it and it was undamaged`, `that on the outskirts of town there is a giant metal dome. Inside this dome is a series of smaller metal domes (like a nesting doll). At the core, rests the still-beating heart of a hill giant that once tended the land with utmost care. The heartbeat, however faint, echoes through the layered domes and grants a calming effect on those that hear it`,

Now, an entire civilization and the lives of every being depends on finding elemental alcheras, holes in reality where the elemental planes poke thru, entering them, and capturing short-lived elementals, then getting out before the alcheras close. This is one of the only known stable alcheras ever found, deep inside a floating island known as "the respite", built up over the years from the floating hulks of several hundred airships of war moored around a small chunk of floating stone a quarter mile across. ships everywhere flock here for water, fresh elementals, and repair, and the weaponry bristling aboard the respite keeps it firmly in the hands of the ruling elite`, `there are remains of an intelligent, prehistoric life form in the centre of the town.
