The energies that leak out around the lock attract evil beings, who in turn attract heroes to fight them, and who in turn attracted shopkeepers who knew the real way to become rich wasn't to go adventuring but to sell swords to the adventurers`, `the town exists at the exact center of a large anti-magic zone, making it ideal for people on the run from some magic-user or merchants who don't want to see a fourth business go up in fireballs`, `that long ago, the avatar of a agriculture deity was sacrificed here. the fallout from her death fertilized the land and has ensured good crops ever since`, `that the town is built up around an oasis which provides a vital resource not found anywhere else nearby. This could be water in a desert, air in an undersea kingdom, or just dependable rules of reality in a chaotic far realm`, `that this town has a connection to a gigantic corpse of some elder god that floats in the void. A mining colony sprung up to harvest body parts for all manner of alchemical and magical reagents. adventurers come to bid on the lucrative contracts to protect the miners from still active antibodies and parasites`, `that this fishing village is built mainly upon the side of a gigantic karst just offshore, accessible by wooden stairways and rope ladders. Those with particularly strong ties to nature (or geology) recognize that this karst is not made of stone, but is actually the petrified remains of a titanic tree that once rose out of the ocean`, `that at the center of a large crater there is a large spring of fresh water, the only source of drinkable water within a hundred miles (a desert, tundra, swamp, or arid savanna). The crater itself is lush and green - nearly tropical, even - and the people enjoy a comfortable existence. However, the inhospitable landscape around the crater leaves the townsfolk unable to travel, and news barely ever reaches them`, `that a geyser at the center of the village deep within the taiga erupts, with clockwork regularity, at noon every day. In the winter, the townsfolk gather around the geyser to enjoy the warm steam from its eruptions, and during the spring children frolic underneath the spout of water and play`, `the mining village has sprung up around the massive hole left in the ground by a passing elder purple worm. the worm disrupted hundreds of thousands of gold worth of ores and precious gems - though only the most experienced miners and spelunkers can safely traverse the deep tunnel`, `that giant metal pumps from ages long ago keep the endless subterranean caverns filled with locked vaults and adamantine doors beneath the city dry enough for explorers to delve. for 300 years, adventurers and archaeologists have flocked here, extracting untold wealth every time a vault is successfully opened`, `that lava from the mountains flows under the town, giving rise to several hot springs`, `that the town is at the edge of a rain-forest, a forest made of literal rain.

Scientists believe that energy can be siphoned from the sky-stompers, which could lead to full-scale industrialization. A fantasy and/or solarpunk setting`, `there is a bottomless pit with an intricate cave system with fertile soil and bioluminescent bacteria meaning free real estate for farming`, `that a spring gushes forth from the center of town, providing a nearly unlimited supply of sweet fresh water. The town has a legend that many centuries past, a nature spirit disguised herself as a homeless traveler and was given warm reception by the town. In return for their kindness she caused the spring to burst forth. Since that time, no wanderer is ever turned away by the townsfolk, some saying that to do so would cause the spring to dry up`, `that a massive telescope like device fell to pieces on the edge of a large desert.

The village has built up around the metallic walls, and use the various game and lumber as their livelihood. Upkeep on the glass dome it top priority`, `the town is ringed by a large wall made out of living trees: in fact a specific tree known as a "walking tree." As it grows, it sends out branches that will eventually root into the ground and grow another trunk. The villagers, over centuries, have carefully pruned and guided the growth of the tree until it has encircled the town. now the roots are deep in the earth, while the trunks are twisted giants blocking all entry. two large gates have been carefully maintained as arching openings in the wall (though canny carpenters have fitted swinging doors to the arches). Some of the branches have been sewn into walkways that mimic battlements and provide protection and security to the defenders. due to its great age, at this point the bark is nearly as hard as stone, heavy with moss that denies fire a purchase, and eerily beautiful`, `the city is built on a extremely wide solid rock plateau. carved into the ground are massive teleportation circles that surround the city. When activated (through some strenuous magical means) it teleports the whole city into a sealed underground cavern with no entrances or exits. Essentially making it an escape bunker until whatever danger was threatening the city passes`, `the ruins of a temple lay in the city center. What's abnormal about this temple is the alter to an unidentified god that constantly sprays fresh clean water from a pot he holds into a fountain beneath him giving the city an unending supply of clean water`, `that the town was built on the back and in the arms of an enormous golem like giant creature who one day started walking out of the side of the mountain where the city originally was built centuries ago. It walks at a pace slow enough to not be felt much by the residents. Perhaps it's destination is important`, `there is a huge intricate sun dial that as well as telling the time for the locals has a tally that is ceremoniously completed every summer solstice. However this coming summer an ancient carving of a skeleton lies in the next available tally spot. There are many rumours of what this foretells but most agree it is the end of times`, `the whole village lies on a rotating stone bed one mile in diameter. Local dwarven miners dug exploration tunnels to determine the cause of this turning. one by one curses, misfortune and death befell anyone who was involved in the mining exploration and thus all efforts have ceased`, `that this village is built in a monstrous towering evergreen tree with an incredibly ornate spiral staircase that traverses around the outside of the bark and a working pulley lift system to transport resources up and down the centre of the trunk.

The small town is built on an artificial hill and the gates are secured at sunrise when the marsh fills with noxious gas`, `that the town is built around a wizard's tower. Every wizard that has taken up residence there has supported and cared for the townsfolk. The town itself is littered with small magical artifacts made by wizards of the tower in days gone by.

When properly prepared, parts of this creature can be used to create potent healing tonics, while if prepared another way, it can be used to create potent poison. The assassin's guild and healer's guild in this town are continually at odds, trying to control the supply of the creatures for their own uses`, `that this is a thriving town built around the corpse of a terrasque felled generations ago. No one has determined a means to permanently kill it so the city corp of miners harvest and despose of matter as fast as it regenerates. Rumor has it that if it were permanently killed it would manifest elsewhere to wreak havoc, that is why more powerful magics are highly regulated in the region`, `that a huge meteor crater that has a lake in it, with an “island” at the centre`, `this village is hellgate - a quaint village built inside of a cavern, inhabited by tieflings, demons, and warlocks. In an adjacent antechamber there is a massive adamantine gate carved with images of debauchery and torments, a pilgrimage site for all who worship the infernal. The town is filled with shops that sell pentacle charms, goat-headed statues, brimstone candles, and other religious paraphernalia. Once a year, the villagers hold a doomsday parade. They march through the streets carrying battering rams, which they take to the antechamber and knock on the hellgate itself. Afterwards, there is much drunknenness and merriment`, `that this town was built around an strange wreck in a crater. The inhabitants of starfell are of an unknown race. They are hospitable but aloof and will not answer questions regarding their nature or that of the wreck. Outsiders are welcome to visit the markets and taverns in the crater, but exploring the ruined structure is forbidden. Any character that is attuned to living things will notice that there are a number of faint life signs emanating from inside the wreck..`, `this town was fractured across multiple realities in a long-forgotten cataclysm. Most of the main streets and markets are in our universe, but beware of entering strange doors or alleyways--they can leave you stranded in a parallel reality if you don't know how to find your way back. The city is filled with the ephemera of other universes: there is coinage bearing the faces of leaders and nations that never existed; there are books filled with spells and alchemical formulae that don't work here; there are pieces of magic and technology that are utterly unknown, and will cease to work if taken far from splinterpoint`, `this town was built on the back of a massive land snail. The crawl has a single main road that winds in a spiral up to the peak of the shell. Most of the time, the crawl stays in the wild areas far from civilization and trade routes--most believe it is nothing more than a legend. The few explorers who manage to find it can trade for healing snail-slime unguents, pearls, and knives and jewelry crafted from nacre`, `that long ago a band of heroes battled a necromancer and were able to defeat him by turning him to stone; the now stone necromancer stands on the hill overlooking the town, covered in graffiti. His finger still points to the town's center`, `that a chain, with links as big as the city itself, is anchored to the earth around the city's borders and protrudes into the sky; nobody knows what it is attached to on the other end`, `this town has a high wall, made entirely of what appears to be skeletons (either made of or possibly coated in metal) with outstretched hands, as though they are reaching for something, that stretches as far as the eye can see; the wall itself exudes a powerful fear aura which deters locals from approaching, peering over, or going around it`, `this town has a very large tree, which, when rested directly under for at least a long rest, permanently bestows the plant sub-type on the resting pc/npc. this change in sub-type can only be reversed with a wish spell; the spell will automatically fail however, if both the afflicted and the caster are not directly under the tree`, `there is a nearby field is full of hundreds of tenser's floating discs which wander the field aimlessly, allowing wildlife to appear to defy gravity. Nobody knows where they came from or how long they have been there, but they range in appearance from completely transparent/translucent to covered in dirt and other sparse natural phenomena. Anyone that is in physical contact with one of the discs may mentally control it at will, but it will not leave the borders of that field`, `that a neighboring village has balls of floating light appearing intermittently that cause anyone that sees them to stop what they are doing, stand in place, stare blindly into the distance, and babble (and sometimes drool) gibberish to themselves for hours. This is a daily occurrence the villagers have turned into a sport they lovingly refer to as "babble-ball" where the last man standing that has not laid eyes on the orbs that day wins. Chikoh is the reigning champion who has not "been babbled" for the past 22 days, since he was last caught with his pants down babbling with the butcher's wife`, `this village has an idiot. This idiot is not just any village idiot, mind you; he is bound to the land, magically speaking of course. When he is happy, the weather is agreeable, crops are plentiful, etc. and when he is feeling bad the weather is extreme for whatever season it currently is, wildlife becomes sparse and hostile, etc. The villagers fear that should he die, the land would die with him, so he is kept indoors and tended to hand and foot like a god in order to keep him safe and happy. He likes to get out and cause mischief though, whenever he can`, `this city has a large pedestal in the middle of downtown there a glass orb sits with an object inside. This object is constantly shifting form to resemble the various currencies of the world. Rumors circulate that if the orb is ever broken whatever currency it is currently in the form of will disappear world-wide, others say that if it is broken whatever currency it is in the form of will erupt forth from it. As a result of these and other rumors, the city guard and local mages college have formed a unified front to defend the orb from any attempt at breaking it open, though all attempts have proven ineffective since a visiting mage from a neighboring city experimented by dropping an elephant on it and it was undamaged`, `that on the outskirts of town there is a giant metal dome. Inside this dome is a series of smaller metal domes (like a nesting doll). At the core, rests the still-beating heart of a hill giant that once tended the land with utmost care. The heartbeat, however faint, echoes through the layered domes and grants a calming effect on those that hear it`, `this desert oasis has its own permanent portal to the elemental plane of ice located just left of the pond in the palm grove. Very popular tourist attraction`, `that this is a simple farming village with really fertile soils. Because after battling at the same exact place for thousands of years, the grounds are fertile due to the excess punts of blood and bone that the ground soaks`, `the only known vein of living silver, a crucial component in the making of great weapons, lies beneath the mines that this village supports`, `a millenia ago, the ancients knew better ways to survive, explore, and travel the great vastness of the sky-void; than capturing and enslaving air elementals to provide lift and thrust to the great ships of etheria. Now, an entire civilization and the lives of every being depends on finding elemental alcheras, holes in reality where the elemental planes poke thru, entering them, and capturing short-lived elementals, then getting out before the alcheras close. This is one of the only known stable alcheras ever found, deep inside a floating island known as "the respite", built up over the years from the floating hulks of several hundred airships of war moored around a small chunk of floating stone a quarter mile across. ships everywhere flock here for water, fresh elementals, and repair, and the weaponry bristling aboard the respite keeps it firmly in the hands of the ruling elite`, `there are remains of an intelligent, prehistoric life form in the centre of the town. When people have touched the remains they gain some sort of change to their self be it they gain magical powers or they lose a limb. The town is based off of the ‘blessing’ of the forgotten one.
