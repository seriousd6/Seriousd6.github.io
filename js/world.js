If one looks directly upon Nimir, it will almost look like you are looking at a mirage.", "Shuggdus – The gargantuan, monstrous-looking, water-based creature.

Whatever this creature consumes increases it’s size.", "The Dreaming Maw – A castle-sized crystal floats above the ground, every so often pulsing red. Its lower half goves way to a mess of tentacles, some hundreds of meters long, that twist and writhe ceaselessly. It moves slowly, inexorably, for reasons unknown, and as it does the lands near it warp; first gaining a slimy texture, then sprouting tentacles, eyes, mouths, arms, then becoming those things until there is no trace of nature in them, only squirming fields of flesh.

Because of their cursed bloodline, their ugly heads are now positioned on seven serpentine necks of a giant hydra-like monster, so they must share the same body and cannot escape each other’s presence. Their domain is the ruins of their kingdom, full with twisted, chimeric monsters.", "Gar-Khoza – Strangely enough, this gargantuan beast is quite passive, usually not paying the living much attention and only ‘feeding’ on corpses and dead plant matter. It resembles a giant amalgam of body parts from various creatures formed into a vaguely humanoid shape. Its state of decay, or lack there of, makes it seem much younger than it actually is. It’s an entity of rot, exhaling and surrounded by a necrotic mist. The occasional animal will make their home inside it, usually a swarm of insects or a vulture perched on its back. It shambles around aimlessly, leaving a trail of harmless, albeit alien, fungi and bugs in its wake. It’s known to defend itself violently if the need arises.", "Gzgeth, The Wandering Maw – This bulbous abomination closely resembles a starfish, but house sized (but technically never stops growing). Long arms that extend out radially, as well as thousands of tube feet that propel it forward (see starfish movement). On the top side of its body where all the arms originate is a massive radial maw that its arms are always dropping things into.

The worm senses and is attracted to the formation of empty husk bodies, like those formed by the Clone spell, and when it draws close enough to be seen twisting and turning in the sky, any creatures created through cloning or through creating genetic copies come out wrong, deformed, warped, often beyond recognition at all, sometimes huge and bloated and other times spindly and wicked. Interestingly, this also affects creatures who have used teleportation magic, as well as any who have been reincarnated or resurrected.", "The Vrenbliock – A gargantuan monster consisting of nothing but murderous eyes, hundreds of long spiny arms, and a large mouth. It disguises its grotesque body as a cloud. It uses its hiding place in the sky and its long arms to reach down and pick up unsuspecting prey. The only problem with its disguise is that it’s closer to the ground than most clouds.", "Crealeth – A hulking monstrosity that waits in the darkest depths. A fleshy transport for the vile creations of the aboleth, the Crealeth is a large whale like creature covered with pustule abrasions that constantly leak a black tar. The creature is host to an exposed maw of needle like teeth as large as the fiercest warrior and a row of blind eyes wrapping around its large dome-like head. The Crealeth is a means to an end, an unstopped leviathan carrying in its stomach the oozing and decaying armies of the aboleth.", "Tagrabui, the Rotten Being of the Marsh – A gargantuan half-decomposed bear with sloth-like front legs, blind eyes and moss growing on its back. Drool drips from its ever open maw: it ultimately hungers for the Sun, which it’s destined to devour when the time is right. Being in its presence causes the sensation of drowning and objects around it act as if they were underwater. Certain swampland tribes, who do not know any better, worship it as a god of death and rebirth.", "Cavestep, The Hill Titan – Thought to be creatures of legend, a Hill Titan rests only a few hours from the player’s hometown. In appearance, they resemble a hill giant, but are much bigger. The back of a Hill Titan is covered in a small mountain range. When they awaken, they rise from the earth, taking everything that was built on top of it with it.", "Graveteeth – This graveyard golem is the result of a necromancy spell gone horribly wrong.

The herder has an odd fascination for the goats of it’s mountains, watching them as a past time. If any harm comes to its goats, the worm will do everything within its power to destroy the attacker.", "Turukto – Told to be a gift from the gods of nature, these crane like creatures stand almost 120 feet tall. They mainly act passive against any creature that approaches it, and if dared one may climb onto its wooden body. On its legs sprouts orange fruits of bittersweet honey that goes well with the view from the top of their body.", "Jericho – An enormous cannon that fires highly destructive bolts of demonic lightning.

It is instead luring travelers and creatures to investigate where it will then smash it’s hand down, killing most creatures caught under it instantly. It is unknown how this statue has appeared in almost every continent. Perhaps it is magic, or maybe perhaps there is more than one. One thing that is certain, however, is that it always seems to appear near holy sites…", "Skylla – A gargantuan creature that lives near coastal towns. She resembles a Hydra in form. Skylla has six heads, and will devour crewman with each of them of any ship that comes too close. She eagerly waits beneath the waves for oncoming sea vessels.", "Nüthmetaya – A gargantuan snake, the size of 20 men around and easily 200 feet long. Many a myth has been based on this beast. Despite the many tales, it is strangely passive, preferring instead to feed on tiny organisms in the waters it swims through. Though it lives underwater for most of its life, it does surface once every 70 years or so for one week to refill its massive lungs. It possesses immense psychic abilities, and uses these to communicate, or to defend itself in the rare occasion something actually threatens it.", "Totoma, the Golden Calamity – Before you stands a dragon unlike any you’ve encountered before. Standing 30 feet tall and at least 50 feet long, Totoma has a mixture of draconic and feline features. His face is an elongated feline face with swept back cats ears and long whiskers, with intelligent amber eyes. A pair of white bone antlers rise from the back of his skull. His elongated body is covered in golden scales that seem to shimmer black, giving the appearance of shifting leopard spots. Around his neck these scales are much larger and longer, giving the appearance of a mane of golden blades. Each of his four legs end in massive paws with wicked hooked claws.", "Akuma, Beast Of The Dark – A giant bear that sleeps within the forest and protects it from harm. Those that dare to enter his domain and harm it must pray that he doesn’t find them. For the ones he manages to kill, he feeds them to his forest friends.", "The Skeletal Titan – The Skeletal Remains of long dead immortals, be they titans, fiends, or even celestials who fell in battle in the wars of the distant past, their corpses may have been left behind and now all that remain are their skeletons, enduring like adamantine. Only the most powerful of necromancers can reanimate these remains, which act as powerful siege weapons and even weapons of mass destruction should the mage be able to channel more of the titans old self. Lesser mages sometimes try to enlarge the remains of already large skeletons, but they never match up with the real thing.", "K’lyfrd the Red – A giant hound, red and large, that wanders the land and befriending folk. Ultimately more of an NPC, as it is not particularly hostile.", "Kwoptarr – A massive frog that lives in a swamp in a massive hollow tree who loves to learn. If you befriend him, his spit is a powerful poison that he will bestow upon people who can tell him a riddle he hasn’t heard before.", "Charybdis – Charybdis looks like a hideous bladder and twice per day gulps up the water of the sea, creating massive maelstroms that utterly devastate any ships that come too close. According to old sea tales Charybdis is the organ of an ancient God of the Sea that has long since been slain.", "The Cadaver Colossus – The Cadaver Colossus is a truly gruesome creation. It is a giant flesh golem created with the bodies of hundreds of corpses. To animate such a massive body of dead flesh, a group of 7 necromancers are needed to conduct the awakening ritual.", "Vegoreth – This creature is a massive bison that roams the great planes and prairies. He normally travels with other bison, who look to him for protection. He is often mistaken for a large hill.", "The Nameless Tunneler – Drow, Svirfneblin, and Duergar mythologies all reference a creature which their cultures first encountered when exploring the deep parts of the Underdark. Something truly massive lives down there, even below the entrances to the Abyss and other portals. Explorers’ logs discuss gigantic walls of slowly undulating gray-green flesh filling tunnels hundreds of feet across, slowly corroding the tunnels with acidic slime, yet expanding to fill the space as well. No head or tail have ever been found, so it’s not known if it’s one creature or many, but known locations are hundreds of miles apart. Hideous parasites like enormous flat ticks are occassionally found and attack all observers viciously.", "The Mithril Defender – A construct created using a ludicrous amount of mithril and multiple uses of the wish spell, the Mithril Defender is possibly the most devastating weapon ever created, save for one flaw. The construct’s two heads are completely independent of one another, leading to it being prone to being easily disoriented.", "The Ruinbringer: Legends say it comes from the outer planes, and others say it’s a twisted form of fiend. Whatever it is, one thing is certain: anything that crosses the path of this dragon-like monstrosity is in danger of total annihilation.", "Black Cloud of Death – These dreadful creatures are incredibly powerful, sentient monsoon-like beings that survive by acts of death and ruin. They appear as thunderclouds, and can be encountered in any warm desert and can move contrary to the course dictated by the wind if it suits them. Their rolling depths do little to conceal the occasional flares of red lightning; the winds that precede them echo with thunder. Their winds carry particles of soot and ash, darkening the ground and the air as they approach.", "Arachnarok – Of the many spiders that infest the world, the gargantuan Arachnarok is the largest of them all. It is a silent predator bigger than a townhouse. In the depths of the forest, the eight-legged monstrosity stalks and entraps entire herds of wildlife, as well as larger prey such as giants. After capturing larger creatures with its rope-like web and flesh-dissolving venom, the spider would begin to drink up the liquefied innards of its paralysed, but still living victim.", "Iceberooze – A gargantuan Ooze that is mistaken for huge icebergs detached from the ice continent. Those poor ships that collided with the ice that surrounds it were absorbed without a trace by this creature. Once, a powerful group of adventurers managed to end one of these Ooze, which grow to these dimensions due to the amount of waste and food they find in the sea, but these adventurers suffered many casualties. If they cut it, it would simply divide. The only way they found they could stop it was to hit it with powerful fire magic.", "Jörmungandr – Also known as the world serpent. His scales extend to the far reaches of each continent as he slumbers within the ocean. Much of his body is often mistaken for mountain ranges. And when he rustles in his sleep the continent quakes. Try not to wake him up.", "Eater of Worlds – A giant, brown worm, with eyes running down its whole body. It splits into smaller worms when cut. Feeds off of sin and Corruption. Always at odds with the Brain of Cthulhu.", "The Brain of Cthulhu – A giant, pink brain, with a mass of tentacle attached to it. Reveals a mouth with jagged teeth, with a heart in the center, after taking enough damage. Controls a Crimson infection. Always at odds with the Eater of Worlds.", "Kalkurruka, The Scream fron the Stars – Most would describe it as a worm that came from the night sky, roiling about with no obvious sign of how it flies. It is entirely covered in mirror-like bladed scales, from the tip of its tail all the way to it’s circular mouth that lead to endless rows of teeth of the same material. No visible eyes, ears, nose, or any limbs. Its scales vibrate a harsh clanging, chittering sound wherever it goes, like a million screams floating by. It will occasionally descend to the ground to devour any plant or animal life in it’s path, growing larger and shedding scales to regrow new ones. Anyone who find and cuts themselves onto those scales may be inflicted with a curse that leads to a slow transformation into a sort of hybrid with mirror scales and only a circular mouth for a head. Kalkurruka and its hybrids seem to be searching for something on this plane, though no one os certain what.", "Black Pudding Lake – This gigantic mass of black ooze slowly creeps along, dissolving and absorbing anything in it’s path. This dark ‘lake’ easily regains any lost material by ‘eating’ everything it dissolves. When it creeps through a city, any buildings in its path are toppled as their foundations are completely eaten away, causing mass destruction.", "Animated Temple – Your party enters a temple that seems unguarded. You quickly and quite easily reach the center where a magic artifact awaits. You take it and begin to feel tremors. The entire temple is shaking around you. You’re running to the exit and are violently thrown around the walls and onto the floor as you make your way out. You see the light but you notice the outside world seems to be moving? You exit the temple and turn around and see that the temple itself is alive, and it wants its heart.", "The Yawning Chasm – A large canyon that is, in essence, a giant mouth. Its opposite walls meet each other over the course of a hundred years so it can absorb or ‘swallow’ the rocks and dirt that have fallen in and been forgotten, thus preventing the creature from ever eroding away. Digging into the its walls can reveal treasures and trash left to the canyon over millenniums. Though the Yawning Chasm is unlikely to bother most living creatures, 100 years is only a quick bite on a geological timescale and quite dangerous for most non-living things. Once the canyon has been sealed, it stays such a way for a year, leaving only a baron, thin stretch of dirt where its lips once were. When it finally begins to open again, it loudly echoes a day-long, droning sound for which it gets its name, after which it will be another hundred years before it is fully open again.", "Reefback Leviathan – Colossal whale like creatures that are often mistaken for moving islands in the oceans they traverse. Their backs are entirely covered with coral reefs and embedded shipwrecks that have collided with it. They are a prey species for a much larger leviathan creature.", "Jorrenfilg – A massive cloud of dark fog, miles across. Somewhere in the cloud is Jorrenfilg, once a beloved queen, now a complete terror. She’s about 20 feet tall, her body gaunt and her skin bronze, both in color and material. Along each of her arms are a dozen silver serpents, able to extend and armed with searing fangs, and her hands replaced with unicorn horns which she uses to help support her frail legs. The fog constantly bellowing out from her lower face, though it clears somewhat in a small area around her, her lower jaw is split apart and now more like two tusks, the upper part of her face is unchanged and that of a beautiful woman, with tears streaming from her eyes and becoming deadly bolts of electricity zipping throughout the fog.", "The Meta-Inevitable – If the plane of Mechanus somehow were to fall in to disarray by it’s own hand from conflicting imperatives or Inevitables, this towering construct will be called into action. Build from clockwork parts, it’s titanic form shakes the earth as it walks the planes with an unstoppable determination to set its lesser versions straight. Half modron, half titan, the Meta-Inevitable will always override its orders from Primus if they conflict with its prime directive from the Creator.", "Ardenvot – Nobody knows what it is, where it came from, or anything else about Ardenvot. Ardenvot wanders the world, usually slowly, killing anything it comes across. It has no destination or objective as far as anyone can tell, but it does often travel in strange patterns, zig-zagging, moving in a circle then spiralling down to the center, going back and forth across random areas, and many more, sonetimes repeating the patterns or ceasing them to start another or travel randomly. The base of its body is a series of hexagonal prisms, 500 feet long, each face 30 feet wide, made of an incredibly tough dull grey metal, forming a larger hexagon. On the inward facing edges of the prisms are white lines, from which spear-like tendrils attack anything in the middle with lightening speed. The prisms are connected to eachother by black spheres with a diameter of 60 feet, from these spheres it can form appendages as it wishes, though fragile and weak they’re able to form legs to hold it up and walk around, and pull or fling whatever life it comes across into the middle.", "Kylix, the Cloud Spider – This colossal silver arachnid hangs from a web of altocumulus clouds past the edge of the world, constantly spinning wispy clouds from the water vapor in the air and feeding them to the wind.", "Quercus, The Living Ecosystem – This gigantic oak-based treant, whose branches are full of life, rests sleepily in the middle of a dense forest. Birds, squirrels, bugs, and bees all nest on or in him and all will defend him with their lives.",

Most people think his face is merely a rock formation.", "Sidderous, the Malevolent Moon – Once a demon lord, Sidderous was tossed into orbit and crushed by space rocks by the Gods, forming a small moon. This moon still contains the demons essence and he can blight the world or cause bad luck on the world below.", "Hoydecko – A stoic, wraith like creature that stands unmoving over the great valley. Hoydecko’s masked face is parallel to the mountains on the horizon. It’s body is almost transparent and things pass through it unharmed. You could be forgiven for mistaking Hoydecko for an illusion, but it’s gentle breathing can be heard and felt echoing behind the mask. Hoydecko has stood longer than the oldest tribes in the valley. He is a feature of many myths and prophecies. What is is there for? Is it sleeping? Standing guard?", "Queen Oryst – The first dwarf. Over thousands of years, she has grown to immense size. Her beard is like a grey forest and her spear is as tall as a mountain. She is wise and peaceful, but has no time for elves and reacts violently to drow. She might be immensely old and patient but she is still a dwarf, grim and doom-driven.", "Teref-zanab, The Many Wormed – A writhing mass of worms that lives below the land, its million appendages gathering information and food for the large, central body that is unknowable under the writhing mass of its body.

Kroll is the byproduct of some ancient goddess who got frisky with some monsters eons ago. It does not have too much sentience, but does remember the thousands of years it has lived so far. Kroll does not like to be disturbed in its solitary life at the coast, but more than that, Kroll does not like to be hungry. And it is always hungry.", "The Wandering Island – Sometimes seen out at sea, appears to be an undiscovered island. However, stories of it’s location are constantly changing. Some people claim to have stepped foot on it only for the island to submerge into the sea, forcing them to swim back to their boat. Others claim to have seen it emerge out of the water. Most people claim that it’s is a reverse mirage, land where there shouldn’t be. Further investigation may reveal that it is a Gigantic Turtle that wanders the ocean.", "Kletterhaus – A somewhat sentient wizard’s mansion on six lengthy limbs of living wood that can be used to walk and climb. When its master is away, it feeds by lowering it’s basement chamber onto trees, opening wide its cellar doors, and then biting off their tops. It runs away from fire, but defends itself against persistent pursuers. The legs regrow, albeit slowly.", "Unz Bak – The name comes from an old orcish dialect, and rather poetically means ‘large ball’. These coast-dwelling beasts are somewhere between reptile and mammal, covered in thick, flexible plates. They can be found squatting above or in ocean shallows, heads rooting around for any food submerged beneath the sandy floor. When a herd has exhausted a stretch of coast, they move to solid land, bite their tails, and roll towards the next stretch. Unz bak are prized for their armor plates and man-sized eggs, which are often deposited close to shores they intend to revisit, but keeping track of them is also important to coastal fishing towns due to the fish swarms that follow in the wake of an unz bak feeding. Unz bak are fairly docile, but can be rather crudely ‘trained’ for battle, a practice that orc warbands have used before for devastating pillages.", "Cloud Drifter – Cloud Drifters are translucent sacks of organs bound inside an oily, bubble-like membrane. Gossamer filaments drift behind them on the winds, catching stray meteoric material and food particles. The one fully opaque part of a cloud drifter is its beak, a metallic, serrated cone between eight to twelve feet long, which can thrust downward to rip the flesh off of any creature that has somehow ascended to the cloud drifter’s altitude, thousands of feet above the clouds. Cloud drifters react poorly to higher air pressure; every bit of their corpses except for the beak tends to disintegrate before reaching the ground, making it hard to prove their existence.", "Trappercaps – Trappercaps are chitinous monstrosities, with twelve gnarled legs supporting a fleshy structure not unlike a mushroom cap, thirty feet in diameter. It has no discernible eyes or head, but the top of its cap is studded with mouth-like orifices. Each orifice contains a hook-tipped tentacle, which trappercaps exude when hunting for prey. They appear to sense primarily through smell, touch, and vibration. Trappercaps lie dormant for weeks, legs burrowed into the ground, letting foliage, debris, soil and snow cover their tentacles until something steps on one, at which point the offended tentacle plows upwards, hooks the unfortunate prey, and retreats back into its corresponding mouth. When overwhelmed with multiple prey items, the trappercap bursts from the ground and begins an indiscriminate, frenzied feast, before relocating at high speed.", "Daruur Adag – This massive creature, often mistaken for several landmotes, drifts through the sky. In actuality, it is a sky octopus clinging to a collection of landmotes, carcasses of sky whales and the ruins of some lost great civilization. It is normally docile, but occasionally releases a stream of flammable gas to adjust it’s bouancy.", "Heke – A massive roc that is three times the size of the average roc.

They are the size of horses, and their tunnels are said to reach the center of the earth. Dwarves love them for the tunneling abilities, but fear the sort of things that they might awaken in the earth below.", "Hellfang the Rat – This disgusting creature resides in the sewers underneath a major city in your campaign.

Anything organic that this creature touches will soon rot and wither away. It takes the form of a massive locust, but walks around on two feet (when not using it’s wings). It tries to spend it’s time desicrating holy temples and shrines.", "Rusted One – While the Rusted One does not have a definitive form, it is a conglomerate of rusted armor that gets left behind in dungeons after their wearer suffers a horrible fate. The creature can smell rust, and immediately drags it’s loud, clanging body through a dungeon to retrieve the fallen armor. After 400 years, the Rusted One has a cult following of dwarves that wish to dig this massive creature out of the mountain, and release it upon the earth.", "Colossal Apes – These immense apes are incredibly dangerous and predatorial. Found on large jungle islands, these apes drive away or kill anything that gets bigger than it, in fear that something might be bigger than them. There aren’t many left on the planet, and fewer live to tell the tale of seeing one in person.", "Roots, the Shambling Mound – Left to grow for centuries, this Shambling Mound is said to have roots that travel for hundreds of miles. Massive trees have grown into the back of Roots, which is a testament to the amount of time that it has laid dorment. Over the past few nights, people in the local village have felt the ground begin to shake. It is time for Roots to awaken.", "Elder Tempest – These creatures are some of the most powerful of Elementals. In this case, the Elder Tempest takes the form of wind.

Abis takes the form of a massive nautalus.", "Agonath-Ra, the Chained Doom – This creature was an evil wizard who transformed himself into a colossal, tarrasque-like monstrosity, lying waste to whole towns. Now he is almost completely paralyzed, buried under a hill. The denizens of his domain built their city upon this hill, most of them unaware of the beast underneath. Some of them discovered the truth though, and use tunnels to reach Agonath-Ra’s body. They harvest his flesh and blood and use them for magical purposes, becoming more powerful – and monstrous – by the process. Agonath-Ra is helpless to stop this torture (though he regenerates quickly any damage), and the occasional earthquake is the most he can do. But he still dreams the day he will break free of his earthly prison.", "Shriek of the Caverns – This obnoxious creature hides in crags and small caves. Its shriek can be heard from miles away, and those who linger too long near it will begin to feel their bones crumble from the pressure created by it. Up close, it resembles an extremely round and fat beetle, however, where its face would be is an impossibly large maw.", "Gorefang, the Gargoyle Lord – This creature is the dread lord of a great gothic city full of gargoyles and other statues, all of which come alive at night. Gorefang sits upon a massive cathedral, waiting for travelers to come to his crumbling city so that he may feed again.", "Pale Strider – From the foggy mist extends a long, gigantic and lithe limb attached to a large clawed foot. The flesh is human like, but is a sickly white and translucent showing the network of veins below. The creature’s body is obscured by an ever present ethereal fog that is chilling. It moves silently for its size and is rarely hostile unless provoked. It’s fog does necrotic damage and wherever it travels, a plague seems to follow.", "Terror of the Sands – This creature resembles a massive scorpion out in the middle of the Taz’ring desert. Brought to life by a sinister cult that could not contain it, this creature wanders the sands looking for it’s next meal. It can run insanely quick for a creature of it’s size.", "Kobold Stack – This ‘creature’ is just ten kobolds standing on each other’s shoulders.

Local funeral homes offers special adamantine caskets so your loved one won’t be eaten by Gravegrub.", "Smiley’ the Serpent Lord – This creature resembles a massive snake with a human face, stuck in a permenant smile. ‘Smiley’ has been seen wandering closer and closer to a swamp village in the region.

They are gargantuan creatures, and their rust colored wings block out the sun when they fly. Rust Dragons feed upon small mountains, trying to get to the delicious ore inside.", "Sheyeoxks – This extra dimensional being, the size of a solar system, creates wormholes to tunnel through the universe one dimension at a time. Its true form, being of hundreds of dimensions, is impossible to conceive. It’s so big it has its own gravitational pull.", "Giant Bees – Originating from deep in the Fey Wild, these bees were created by an ancient order of druids that sought to protect their domain. Unfortunately for the druids, these creatures are bumbling and lazy, just like a normal bee. Every once in a while, a riff in the Fey will open up and one of these bumbling oafs will make it’s way into your realm. While they are funny to look at, if provoked, they can become very dangerous.", "Bismark – One of the first complex creatures to evolve on this plane, Bismark started out as a nautilus type creature feeding in primordial seas as an alpha predator.

    "Orb of Planar Melding: This orb allows the user to overlap planes of existence through a complex ritual. Whether razing cities by combining it with the plane of fire, or using it to open up the world to an army of demons and undead, the scale provides dangerous power. Destroyed by: utilizing the orb to combine opposites such as the Positive and Negative Energy planes, or Feywild and Shadow Planes together, the artifact will implode taking a radius of 200 ft with it.", "Ark of Famine: At first glance, this wooden box appears much like a child’s coffin – a long wooden box, completely unadorned, full of sand and designed to be carried by two pallbearers using handles over the shoulders. However, the Ark houses the collective spirits of those killed by hunger and crop blights long ago. Drawing on these spirits, the Ark consumes any and all crop or plant matter in a maddened hunt for nourishment. Destroyed by: Wherever it goes, any plant matter or food within 300 feet is destroyed and cannot be recovered. Prying the Ark open and filling it with water will destroy it.", "Heart of Magic: The still beating heart of one of the most powerful sorcerers who ever lived. The magic in their blood still powers the heart. The heart can be used as a spellcasting focus, and when used as such, all spells made with the heart count as two levels above the level of the spellslot used. Flaw- the heart is still unstable, and all physical damage done directly to the heart causes the heart to violently react. When this happens, the heart gives off a violent blast of magical energy, dealing radiant damage equivalent to the original attack in a 20ft radius sphere. If attacked by necrotic damage this ability does not trigger, and the heart takes double damage. Destroyed by: The heart has 100 HP total. If the heart reaches 0 due to physical damage, it violently collapses, dealing 10d10 radiant damage in a 300ft sphere. If the heart reaches 0 due to necrotic damage, the heart slowly begins to shrivel up, until it is about the size of a grape, at which point it collapses into dust.", "Eldritch Rod: Created by an unknowable primordial deity, it appears to be composed of dark oak into the shape of a long tendril. While the wielder may use it to have an additional 10 spell slots, any spell cast through it will have a wild effect to it of an evil nature. The woes of the user do not end there however, the rod with also wrap around the wrist of the caster permanently until a way to remove it is found. The longer one is attached, the more evil and chaotic in nature they will become, slowly connecting their mind to that of the incomprehensible deity that created the rod. This link could have it omniscient benefits however if the user seeks to please their new god. Destroyed by: The cursed wielder must cut off the arm that is binded, burning it along with the cursed artifact. If it is simply burned without sacrifice the character will have angered the deity, if it is not purified in flame the mental link will remain.", "Gravestone of Decay: By chiseling a name of a person, place, or concept into the stone, it will begin to wither away across the material plane and die. A person will take minutes, whereas a city could take months or years, and entire concepts (freedom, justice, etc.) could take centuries. Destroyed by: The only way to destroy it is for someone to selflessly carve their own name into the stone.", "The Key: It looks and feels very much like a normal key, but emits an intense magical aura. The key can open any door in existence. It can even be used, to create and open a door out of thin air that leads to where it’s user desires. It’s more than a mere teleport. It can be used to enter a parallel room in which the user is able to see the world without anyone seeing him. He can’t collide or interact with anything in the “real” world though. Even traveling between universes and realities is possible. The magical power can also be used to cast spells. Destroyed by: Since once you’ve unlocked a normal door, it stays unlocked, the doors that the Key opens stay open until you have left back through the door you have created. Thus, the only way to destroy the Key would be to open the room where you are unable to interact with anything, and then leave the key in that room, and then close the door. This would render the key stuck in a place which no longer exists. Bonus points for going into multiple layers of that room and leaving it deeper.", "The Rift Sigil: A sigil of an arcane rune, which, when placed on a surface creates a hole which expands 1d10 feet in all directions each week. The hole is an extradimensional rift which consumes objects and creatures that it encounters: the passage is one way, and creatures and objects that pass through it are destroyed. A creature may willingly enter the hole: a creature that does so survives the trip, as their willpower keeps them from being consumed by the void on the other side. They take 1d10 psychic damage per minute while here. Destroyed by: A runestone exists inside this realm: it is sentient, and has the following statistics. Rift Sigil Rune: AC 18, HP 100, SPD 0 S:10 D:10 C:18 I:22 W:22 C:22 Damage Immunities: Bludgeoning, Slashing, and Piercing damage made by nonmagical weapons, and psychic damage. Actions: At will: Confusion, Slow, Eldritch Blast (3 Blasts) Intelligence is the spellcasting ability for these spells.", "Spear of Thirst: This spear is +4 to hit and does 1d12 piercing damage plus 1d12 necrotic damage as it sucks fluids from the victim’s body. On a critical hit, the victim must make a DC 15 CON save or die, drained to a husk. The wielder gets 1d4 temporary HP each time it kills someone with a spear. Destroyed by: Submerge it in the body of a radiant creature like an angel. Or an undead: it can’t drink from the undead.", "Heart of Gold: An artifact that if the user holding it kills an unwilling good oriented user, all evil oriented characters in the nearby vicinity have a one in (number) chance of becoming increasingly good natured depending on how much good of a person the sacrifice was (up to DM’s discretion). However, this also works the other way around. Introduction: The protagonist could be either extreme good or extreme evil character killing like-oriented individuals. The PCs then find out about the heart. Destroyed by: The heart loses HP for each willing participant (depending on how much of a good or bad person they were). The heart originally starts with 1HP but increases with every unwilling participant of the ritual by 1 point.", "The Orb of Omniscience: Like a crystal ball with telepathy but anybody can use it any number of times per day. Best not to be destroyed, best if the party takes it for their own use. Destroyed by: Can be melted in lava.", "Sarcophagus of Rejuvenation: This ancient sarcophagus has incredible regenerative properties. Spending a short rest inside it restores all hitpoints and cures minor diseases. Spending a 8h inside of it can bring a man back from the brink of death, regenerate limbs and halt aging. Spending time inside of it without any injuries starts to drain a person’s humanity and they move closer to chaotic evil alignment. Destroyed by: The sarcophagus power can be disabled by placing a wonderus item of legendary power that’s intent is to cause harm. After that the sarcophagus is able to be destroyed by a magical weapon.", "Metallurgist’s Bible: This ancient book conveys upon it’s user the ability to make masterworks of war. Any weapon crafted with this artifact’s knowledge does double the amount of damage dice (1d6 shortsword –> 2d6). To retain this feature, the weapon must be soaked in the blood of an ancient red dragon once a year. Destroyed by: For every point of damage it takes, it immediately heals the same amount, and conjures a spectral weapon that seeks out it’s attacker and does the same amount of damage back. The only way to destroy it is to burn it in the fires of the forge where it’s first weapon was created.", "Clockwork Heart: While in the process of creating the Modrons, Primus created a clockwork heart. Since this heart wasn’t useful to making the Modrons he set it aside and forgot about it. In order to attune to this artifact you must hold it pressed to your heart during a short rest. The artifact slowly enters your chest and fuses with your heart. Unattuning kills the person because the artifact can’t be unfused from their heart. While attuned to this artifact you have advantage on death saving throws. Also you can open up a portal that leads to the plane of Mechanus or back to the material plane from Mechanus once per day. Modrons recognize Primus’ creation and will avoid fights with the person attuned the clockwork heart unless they are attacked. Once a creature has attuned to the Clockwork Heart, they begin to gradually lose the ability to feel emotion and instead become more logical. The process is slow, but speeds up significantly whenever an aspect of the heart is used (such as opening a portal to Mechanus or making a death saving throw only because of the advantage provided by the artifact). At the end of the process, the creature will be completely unable to experience any emotion and will become a logic-centered being. Destroyed by: The heart most be brought to a plane of chaos, tainting it. Once the heart is tainted, it can be destroyed as a normal object.", "The Ring of Infinite Wisdom: While wearing this ring you can tap into some of it’s infinite wisdom by sucking your thumb. While you are tapping into the ring’s wisdom in this way your current wisdom score increases by 10 up to 30 temporarily, and you even receive premonitions of the future. Destroyed by: The ring can only be destroyed in a 10 minute bath in the tub of the demon prince of foolishness.", "The Brain Staff: A long wooden staff with a pink orb on one end. It can efortlessly control the minds of any monster it’s user desires, and is able to control an infinite number of creatures at once. The user can give it simple instructions that the beast will follow until the day it dies, and keep commanding it. Destroyed by: The Staff is also able to control the minds of creatures emotionally bound to people, like pets and familiars. However, the person who the creature was bound with can attempt to break the spell by making the monster recognize him/her (which would take some time and Wisdom checks). When that happens, both the staff and it’s user are overpowered and explode in a 300 feet radius.",
    "The Infinite Locket: This mysterious pendant, when viewed, takes the viewer to a realm of their own memories, where they relive their favorite memories. The pendant slowly drains them of their life until nothing remains. Destroyed by: Must be opened and viewed to work. Because it can’t move, it’s very easy to become lost. If somebody closes the pendant, the spell is broken, but the victim is left with a feeling of longing.", "The Mark of Ancestry: This wrapping bonds to the user, allowing them commune with all those who have bore the mark before. They lend the user their wisdom and muscle memory, allowing the user to perform feats beyond that of their skill. Destroyed by: The mark technically steals a portion of the user’s soul when used. Additionally, if the mark becomes unbonded from a user, that user can never bond with the mark again, as their soul has already been collected.", "The Machiavellian Mirror: The Machiavellian Mirror allows viewers to cast spells through it or freely scry on any location or being the viewers are knowledgeable of. The mirror itself can also cast various mind control spells on targets visible in the mirror at the user’s behest (DM’s discretion on which and the number of uses per day). The insidiousness is multiplied because the mirror’s control is such that targets may not realize that they were influenced by a spell, especially if they were only instructed to do reasonable things. The mirror can even be used to disadvantage the charisma and wisdom saving throws of targets visible in it if needed. Other Suggestions: The Machiavellian Mirror’s owner should be intelligent and paranoid, someone who takes all sorts of mundane and magical precautions to prevent the mirror from being visible and even having a reflection, especially when not in use. The owner should also take precautions to make sure they are knowledgeable of even potential threats, and that they are visible and findable at all times (e.g. command a ring of spies). Destroyed by: If the Machiavellian Mirror can “see” its own reflection clearly, (e.g. another mirror or smooth surface polished finely is brought into close range in appropriate lighting conditions), the mirror spontaneously smashes itself into smithereens and becomes useless. Viewing another mirror through the Machiavellian Mirror does not count.", "Seed of Iron: As the first seed of the first iron-wood tree, the small seed holds the power of a strong nature deity. Whenever the seed is allowed to touch dirt, the seed immediately burrows into the earth. In a 2000ft radius, a forest of iron wood trees will begin to grow. They require no water and will dig through anything in their way. When the forest is done growing, a small tree made entirely of iron will appear in the center of the forest. In a year it will produce another seed of iron. The forest is neither good nor evil but flows with wild magic and may become home of fey creatures if given time. Destroyed by: If delt 75 points of damage the seed will be destroyed. When the forest is in the possess of growing the seed will stay 30 feet below where it was planted, surrounded by a hostile plant creature made of ironwood. If killed , the seed with die and the forest will die with it.", "The Dionysus Rod: The wielder of this item can loosen the inhibitions of anybody the wielder sees fit. Promiscuity, risk, eccentricity, and general impulsiveness. The more the rod is used, the more the wielder slips into madness, eventually being unable to control the rod’s power. Destroyed by: It can only be broken by those who have broken free from the rod’s will. Once you restrain yourself from the rod’s call to impulse, snapping the rod in two is as simple as finding the holder.", "Chalice of Plenty: A solid gold wine chalice encrusted with a diamond and ruby rim. The one who possesses this item will find themselves increasingly successful in matters of finance and trade. The chalice influences its owner to become increasingly gluttonous in all aspects, to the point of eventual demise. Destroyed by: The curse can be lifted if its owner uses the wealth gained strictly for benevolent purposes, which reverses the effect. To fully destroy the item, the wielder must adopt an ascetic lifestyle and resist temptation until their death, upon which the chalice will melt down into liquid gold and evaporate.", "The Crown of Hosts: A silver crown with six vertical ornate peaks that reach straight up one foot, each inset with a translucent green sphere. Each sphere houses the trapped spirit of a spellcaster that slightly glows within. The wearer of the crown must be a spellcaster and can command the spirits to cast whatever spells they knew in life. This can be potentially devastating, allowing 6 actions, plus the spellcaster’s, per turn.

Lore: the great-auntie Hag Fibblestitch sowed the cloth of the cloak from the black hair of children she kidnapped over a dozen years. She would lure them into the Crestwood, and once they were lost, send her pack of shadow hounds upon them. Once she completed the cloak, she gave it as a boon to a Rightous Paladin who wished to find the evil that was stealing kids. Many years would pass while possessing it, as he searched for the cause. When he learned the truth of his gift, he was driven mad with grief and self-loathing. The Paladin would end up jumping off a bridge to end his own life, and his corpse can be found at the bottom of a lake now. The cloak was retrieved by the hag, and continues to be given to would-be heroes. Destroyed by: the Paladin had a knife given to him by the mother of the first child lost. A simple steel dagger, it still remains as sharp as it was since the paladin lived. Only it can cut the cloak.", "Mask of Thespari: This mask, when worn, allows the wearer to imitate any person perfectly, using a combination of illusion, enchantment, and transmutation magics. Not even close friends or family members will be able to easily see through the disguise. Destroyed by: If the wearer of the mask says their own real name while disguised, the mask is destroyed.", "Plow of Blight: This ordinary looking wooden plow corrupts any ground it plows. Any crops planted in this corrupted soil grow to become hoards of evil plant creatures. Destroyed by: Certain archdruids can learn an ancient ritual to destroy this accursed plow.", "Powerseeker: This purple orb knows where many artifacts of great power lie, and it will show where they are to those who it deems worthy. Destroyed by: The Powerseeker crumbles to dust when all the great artifacts it knows about are destroyed.", "The Black Ring: A glass ring with darkness inside it. Any corpse that the wearer touches rises to become a zombie under the wearer’s control and the wearer can try to bring undead not under their control under their control. Destroyed by: The ring is destroyed if it is thrown into the sun, good luck!", "The Shattered Sword of Quo Yang: This once ornate and beautifully crafted sword is broken into several shatters of steel and a hilt with a jagged cracked blade still attached. If the sword can be reforged to its former glory, it is believed that the wielder can unite and rule a broken and divided kingdom to return it to power. Destroyed by: Only by offering all the pieces to an active volcano.", "Whistle of the Imperator: This whistle when heard requires a save to not fall into a temporary catatonic state prone to suggestion. Reflex save for a chance to block your ears, fortitude save to not fall into the standing coma, and a will save to resist against the suggestion. The blower of the whistle requires some sort of ear impairment or risks knocking themselves vulnerable to sleep and suggestion. Destroyed by: The whistle itself is actually quite ordinary aside from functionally protecting what is inside. The magic comes from a small stone of enchanted onyx inside the chamber. Removing the stone neuters the enchantment, but destroying it requires using the onyx as a component in another spell or ritual.", "Ascot of the Serpent: This shiny silk ascot woven with various shades of green thread holds the power of a demonic snake god. Wearing the scarf will fill the user with power, while slowly transforming them. After a period of time, the wearer is reborn as a snake servant of the demonic snake god. Destroyed by: After days of careful study, a practiced tailor of seamstress can discover the locking knot to begin unwinding the fabric. Once reduced to a single continuous string, the enchantment is broken and the string can be destroyed by any normal means.", "Needle of Unstoppable Destruction: This needle looks perfectly mundane, but it is perhaps the most dangerous instrument of entropy in the multiverse. Anything that touches the point of the needle cracks and unravels and crumbles to dust, and I do mean anything, including any artifact on this list. Destroyed by: There is no known way to destroy this thing, your best bet is to cast it out of reality itself. USE WITH CAUTION!",
