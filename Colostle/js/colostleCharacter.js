    let calling = [
        `There is an army sweeping through the lands around your village. You have heard tales of their unstoppable nature; burning villages in their wake, their men clad in monstrous, spiked black armour. One night they arrive at your village; it is chaos, people screaming, running for their lives, the roofs of your people’s huts and tents ablaze, lighting up the night sky. But most terrifying of all... Rooks, following their general’s commands, their eyes burning with a purple flame. No-one has ever commanded a living Rook before - how is this possible? You survive. Maybe you’re left for dead, maybe you hide. Maybe they took someone you love, maybe you just want revenge... either way, you will need to get to the bottom of the mystery of the Black Army and the Rooks of Purple Flame.`,
        `You have a vision as you sleep one night; far across the lands, in a room that looks nothing like the room your village resides in, is a tower. The tower looks like it might have been a Rook once; thin and impossibly tall with its slender arms by its sides. In your vision you see a weapon in a room at the very top of the tower, waiting, calling for you. Your village has been besieged by Rooks lately, your hunters are stretched thin. Maybe, if you could reach this mythical place, you might be able to save your village?`,
        `It flew overhead, casting a shadow black as night in the middle of the day - the Dragon Rook, the only Rook known to fly. You hear whispers and rumours of a party heading out to hunt it... they say if you can defeat it, you will gain the ability to fly... you can’t let them get to it first.`,
        `Most villages and peoples living in the Colostle have a passive opinion about the Rooks; they are simple wildlife and rarely seen, nothing to be too worried about. But not your village. Your village has hated all Rooks ever since one ploughed right through the centre of your homes, killing loved ones and disappearing into the night. Which is why your secret friendship with a very unusual Rook would not go down well with the villagers if they ever were to discover it. You meet your friend in a nearby forest as often as you can. It doesn’t talk, but it doesn’t attack; it’s not like other Rooks but you don’t know why. One day when you pay it a visit, it is gone from its usual place, and there are signs of a scuffle and a trail leading off into the distance. You have to go find it.`,
        `As a child, your mother used to tell you stories of warriors with diamond skin, morphing weapons of magma and obsidian blades that never dulled. Their powers came from the Fabled Rookstones; ancient one-of-a-kind stones, hundreds of them, made of a different rock, crystal or gem and each holding a unique magical power. It wasn’t true of course; there are only 3 kinds of Rookstones, Ice, Shock and Rumble, and all Rooks have one of these. Everybody knows that. But now, as an adult, you know a little more, you’re a little wiser to the world. And you know that stories like that don’t exist without a grain of truth. What if the legendary Rookstones actually exist?`,
        `A map and a key passed down in your family. The map covers a huge area; you can see multiple rooms - and you’ve never even seen the edges of your Room! 5 locations are marked on it with different coloured glyphs. The locations look like ancient Rook bodies, long since fallen, rotting like ancient temples. The key is ornate and strange, with a Rook symbol carved into its head. It looks like it would fit into a Rook. Maybe those 5 ancient Rook bodies are locked, and only you have the key. But what could possibly be hidden within?`,
        `You are a member of an order of Knights. Knights have one job: They are highly trained and conditioned to take on Rooks and are some of the greatest Rook fighters in all of the Colostle. Your superior in your Order has called you into his office, and he has a mission for you...`,
        "Legend speaks of an ancient prophecy that foretells the rise of a powerful Rook King who will unite all Rooks under his banner and bring either ruin or prosperity to the land.

                `The Armed quite literally have an arm from a Rook connected to them via a complex ritual, attuning its intention to them. The Armed are proficient in melee combat and are highly capableadventurers. They are warriors. An Armed adventurer could have any type of arm; a blade, a hand, a cannon, a strange machine the user doesn’t yet understand. If the arm has a hand or the ability to hold items, it can be used to carry an additional weapon if you have one.`,
            'extended description': 
                `The process of bonding with a Rook Arm is known as ‘The Grafting’. Depending on the person’s constitution, the size and weight of the Rook arm, and those who are carrying out the ritual, this process can vary from simple and painless to lengthy and painful. Because of this, Arm users tend to be battle-hardened and tough, chosen to wield an Arm because they are strong enough. Despite the immense toughness of the Armed, wielding an Arm can still take a great toll on them. Sometimes it can hurt because of its weight, or when it lifts something heavy, it tugs against the user’s body. Other times there is a mental weight, a stress in the mind when coercing it to follow command. Arm users can have any number of arms attached to them, limited only by the physical and mental weight they can bear and the size and complexity of the arms they have. Arms come in all shapes and sizes. Some are like human arms with joints and multi-fingered hands; these tend to be the easiest to wield as they challenge the mind in the same way that a human arm does. But some arms are strange or very different; like coiling segmented plates that flow like a snake, or spidery multi-jointed arrangements that split and separate. Some arms can be big and bulky enough to lift the user off the ground or carry incredibly heavy weights. Others allow users to do fine detailed work that they could never normally do with their human hands. Some Arm users claim to see messages or hallucinations, believed to be the memories of the Rook the arm came from. A complex meditation ritual involving exotic herbs and roots can allow an Arm user to see these memories more clearly and try to understand the Rooks and their purposes better. The images are always hazy and vague but there is a very real sense of a semblance of sentience even though it is generally thought that they are just machines and only Rooklings have sentience.`,

Rooklings can vary in size from very small (the size of a kitten) to the size of a person. A Rookling will have the body and magic characteristics of the large Rook it was harvested from. To create your first Rookling, head to the ‘Creating your Opponent - Rooks’ section in the combat rules to either choose the body and magic characteristics, or draw cards to create them randomly. No two Rooklings look alike, just like the Rooks they come from, and many of them can be very strange shapes. The only consistent characteristic across them all is that they are made of stone, and seem to feature castle elements but on a much smaller scale; such as doors, windows, crenellations, tiny balconies, drawbridges, and sometimes even tiny gardens in miniature courtyards jutting out of the sides of their bodies. Fighting with Rooklings involves fighting in a partnership with your companion. Your character will have a weapon in their hands, but when you do an UNARMED or MAGIC attack this might be a moment where you command your Rookling to fight, or use its magic! Maybe it has ice powers, or the ability to roll into a ball and smash into its opponents. Maybe it can climb inside an enemy Rook and do damage from within, or maybe it can throw you high into the air to bring a weapon attack down on an enemy; the only limit is your imagination! When fighting with your Rookling companion, think about what it is about your partnership that makes you skilled Rook hunters. Maybe you even have some special moves that you can do together due to a convenient combination of specialities!`,

                `The Helmed are the closest to wizards or alchemists in the world of Colostle. Understanding the magical properties of Rooks and how to harness them is partly a pursuit of arcane knowledge and also one of logic and crystal-engineering, like magical circuitry. Any human-made devices that use Rookstones, like lanterns or refrigeration chambers, are made by the Helmed, or someone who would be a great candidate for a Helm. This knack for Rook alchemy is rare and even if it manifests in someone, there is then the added challenge of defeating a Rook to obtain the part or parts usable to create a Helm. However, once done, unlike the Arm which requires attunement and a great toll on the body, the use of a Helm is purely operative, there is no attunement required. It is, however, complex and a deep understanding is required. The Helmeds skills are the most sought after in society. Manipulating and understanding the magical ‘technology’ of the Rooks allows people luxuries beyond the reach of human technology. This can mean one of two things for the Helmed, they are either venerated, or enslaved, depending on the nature of the person who comes across them. Others still consider the Helmed to be Rook sympathizers or ‘witches’. They are thought to be brainwashed with a Rooks thoughts infecting and affecting their own, as such they are often driven out of smaller settlements and distrusted in larger ones. Some religious zealots consider the use of the Rookstone magic to be heresy; consorting with the monsters that threaten everyday life for people.

                `The Mounted ride an adapted mechanism taken from Rook parts, as a vehicle or mount to allow them easier traversal across the land and sea of the Colostle. Typically this involves taking a part of the Rook responsible for it’s locomotion and disconnecting it from the main body, and turning it into something that can be operated with crude controls, mechanisms and levers. The Mounted’s mounts can vary from horse-like creatures to boats and even bikes.`,
            'extended description':
                `Like the Helmed, the Mounted are gifted Rooksmiths, with a basic understanding of their functionality. But unlike the Helmed who have an understanding of the magical circuitry and therefore magical abilities of a Rook, the Mounted have a mechanical one. The Mounted are nomads and scavengers, constantly on the hunt for felled or ancient decaying Rooks and harvesting parts for their own mount. Partly to upgrade, and partly to just keep it going, as mounts require constant maintenance, like off-road vehicles. A Mounted’s mount is their heart and their life. Like looking after a bike or a beloved car, it is everything, it is their freedom. When you defeat a Rook or come across a husk out in the wilds, your character can take parts to upgrade or add to the functionality of your mount. This functions as a story opportunity for your character. Perhaps you took damage in your last battle and you take pieces from a fallen Rook to repair it. Maybe where once there were wheels, you attach legs in their place. Individual parts of Rooks seem to function on their own. If you remove a spinning wheel from the core of a Rook it will continue to spin on it’s own. If you take a leg mechanism; it will still have power despite being disconnected. This means any part that isn’t completely smashed to splinters can be made useful to a Mounted. Mounted are capable of battling Rooks and do so using the Mount’s built in Weapons (for example a cannon or a battering ram). In COMBAT, if you draw a WEAPON attack you can use your Mount’s weapon or one that your character carries in their hands. The Mounted have a low starting COMBAT score but as you explore more you will find ways to increase that score. Don’t see this as a limitation. Instead, it is a storytelling opportunity to have your character go on an adventure of growth.`,

On their adventures, Allied characters may win arms, helms, Rooklings or mounts from their various battles or encounters and can equip them  to either character leading to an Allied being able to have a sort of multi-class effect.

All ‘Within’ start life as a different class - and when piloting their Rooksuit it acts as a temporary upgrade until they elect to leave it for some reason. While ‘Within’, a player has a few options available to them: Firstly they can fly. They can use this ability to fast travel across the battlements, or reenter the Rooms below and fly across those lands. On top of that the combat stats for a Within are immensely high, making you nearly unstoppable against other Rooks. Being Within means you are not subject to Astrolithic Rook attacks whilst within the Rooksuit. The instant you leave the suit, the Astrolithics may notice you again. You have attacks: (LASER ATTACK The Rook seems to charge some kind of glass or crystal emitter and then suddenly a blast of white heat flashes from the end and hurtles towards your character in a straight line | FLYING ATTACK The Rook swoops out of range of your attacks only to swing around in the air and lash out at you as it flies back. | GRAB ATTACK A stone hand unfolds from a hidden location and grabs you, at the same time, the Rook hurtles into the sky carrying you upward. A fall from this height could really hurt! | ROCKET ATTACK The Rook disconnects a part of itself, perhaps one of its arms or a small turret and it blasts towards you with the same propulsion as the Rook has itself for flight. Your character braces as the stone missile streaks toward you...) piloting an Astrolithic Rook. 
                When writing your Within character think carefully about what this means for your character’s story. It could be considered an end, your warrior/adventurer reaching the zenith of legend; the highest power of all. Or perhaps this power changes your character somewhat; for good or for bad. Or you could continue your journey; now as a near invincible hero and your story could introduce moments of peril by being separated from your Rooksuit or having it stolen from you. The Within is intended as the peak of your potential rewards; a gift to a player so that there is something at the end of the adventure to aspire to. But just imagine how the other characters you have met might react to seeing you in a Rooksuit - or what it might mean for advancing the story of your character’s Calling.`
